  If a file has been successfully validated, the relevant information will be extracted according to <code>extraction rules</code> which can be configured below.
  These rules are applied to the uploaded data consecutively in the defined order. If no rules are configured, no data are extracted.
  All the data extraction steps are executed on the participant's device in the browser using JavaScript.
</p>

<p>To configure the data extraction, follow these steps:</p>

<ol class="mb-2 mt-2">
  <li>
    For every field that you want to keep in the uploaded data, create an <code>extraction rule</code> with the "Keep field" operator.
  </li>
  <li>
    Next, you can add rules to filter (i.e., delete) or alter entries in the uploaded data. For this, several comparison and regex operations are available (see below for an overview).
  </li>
</ol>

<p>When a file is uploaded, the configured rules are applied row-wise/entry-wise. This means, for every data row/entry in the uploaded data, the rules are applied in the configured order.</p>

  <sup>1</sup>Dates are inferred from string values if they are formatted according to ISO, RFC2822, or HTTP standards,
  and only if both the field value and the comparison value follow the same format. Otherwise, the entry will be treated as a regular string.
