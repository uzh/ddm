The default admin templates include a minimalistic header and footer that do not integrate any actions related to
a researchers user account because authentication is handled by the main website (see <<User Authentication>>).

However, for your own project you may wish to replace the default header and/or footer within the admin interface
to include your own branding and provide your users with some account management options such as a logout button.
This can be done by using Django's template inheritance.

In your application create a new html template `your_application/templates/ddm/admin/base.html`. In this file,
you can overwrite the header and/or footer as follows:

[source]
----

{% extends "ddm/project_admin/base.html" %}

{% block extrahead %}
    <!-- If you wish, you can integrate some custom css files here -->
{% endblock %}

{% block header %}
<div>
    <!-- Your Custom Header HTML -->
</div>
{% endblock %}

{% block header %}
<div>
    <!-- Your Custom Footer HTML -->
</div>
{% endblock %}
