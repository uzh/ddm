learn more about its development in general.

== Development Guidelines

=== Local Project for Development and Testing

The repository includes a django test project that can be used for local development and testing.

==== Setup

===== Install required packages
Once you have cloned or forked the GitHub repository, activate your local virtual environment and install the following requirements:

[source]
----
(venv) <...>/ddm> pip install -r requirements.txt
----

===== Adjust Test Configuration
A basic standard configuration for the test project is specified in
`test_project/test_config.json`. Adjust the information in this file if you
want to use a custom setup, or use another database. By default, the test project
uses SQLite as a database backend.

If you do make changes to this file, please do NOT commit these changes to the
shared repository.


==== Commands

Through the setup described above, the regular django commands are now available:

===== Run Development Server

To start the development server use the following commands:

[source]
----
(venv) <...>/ddm/test_project> python manage.py runserver
----

===== Create Database Migrations

To create new migrations based on the changes made to the models, run:

[source]
----
(venv) <...>/ddm/test_project> python manage.py makemigrations
----

===== Apply migrations

To apply existing migrations to your local database, run: footnote:[If you are running a version of Python < 3.9, you might have to manually enable the JSON1 extension on SQLite for the migration to work properly. For an explanation on how to do this visit https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/JSON1Extension.]

[source]
----
(venv) <...>/ddm/test_project> python manage.py migrate
----

===== Run Unit Tests

To run unit tests, use:

[source]
----
(venv) <...>/ddm/test_project> python manage.py test ddm
----

=== Vue Integration

==== Development

First, install the appropriate node.js version according to the `.node-version` file. Then, install the
node dependencies:

[source]
----
(venv) <...>/ddm/frontend> npm install
----

To run the app in development mode, you will need to serve both Djangoâ€™s dev server and the webpack development server:
From the frontend directory, run:

[source]
----
(venv) <...>/ddm/frontend> npm run serve
----

And, in a separate terminal in the Django root directory, run the Django development server:
[source]
----
(venv) <...>/ddm/test_project> python manage.py runserver
----

Open your locally hosted Django app in a browser (e.g. http://localhost:8000). Changes to the vue code will trigger an
automatic reload of the page in the browser.

==== Production Deployment

When it is time to deploy, or when you simply want to omit running the Vue dev server,
you can build the Vue project in production mode.
Cancel the `npm run serve` process if it is running and instead run `npm run build`.
The optimized bundles will be built in and placed into the Django static file location,
and webpack-stats.json will be updated to reflect this new configuration.
The vue builds should end up in the static folder of the django module (ddm/static).


=== CI/CD

This project uses _GitHub actions_ for automated testing and CI tasks.


==== GitHub Actions

A **push to develop** triggers build tests for the following configurations:

- Python: [3.8, 3.10.4]
- Database: [sqlite, mysql]

A **tag (vX.X.X) push to develop** triggers build tests (see above). If the tests are successful
develop is automatically merged into main.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Please make sure that pushed tags are in sync with package versions on PyPi.

If the build-tests of a pushed tag fail, delete the tagfootnote:[To delete a tag, first run `git tag -d tagname` then
`git push --delete origin tagname`.] and push the fixed version again with the same tag until the tests run through.
====

A **push to main** triggers build tests and if the tests are successful, automatically
bumps the version number (patch number) and builds a new PyPi package.
The tests have the same configurations as on develop.

A **pull request to main created by dependabot** will automatically update the
affected dependencies and merge into main.


==== Pipeline

A regular **push to develop** triggers the following pipeline:

1. Run tests on develop.
2. Create new documentation for GitHub pages.

A **tag ("vX.X.X") push to develop** triggers the following pipeline:

1. Run tests on develop.
2. Create new documentation for GitHub pages.
3. Merge develop into main.
4. Run tests on main.
5. Create PyPi package.

A **pull request to main created by dependabot** triggers the following pipeline:

1. Update dependencies.
2. Merge into main.
3. Run tests on main.
4. Create PyPi package.


==== Release

A new **release** is created manually and includes:

- Bumping the minor or major part of the version.
- Updating setup.cfg.
- Ideally, add a changelog.
