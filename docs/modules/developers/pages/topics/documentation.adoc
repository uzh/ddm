== Organization of the Documentation

All documentation files reside in the `docs` folder.

AsciiDocs and Antora are used as documentation frameworks. The online documentation is automatically compiled (see
`.github/workflows/publish-docs.yml`) when pushed to GitHub, after the workflow `.github/workflows/test-develop.yml`
has run successfully.

The configuration for local testing compilation of the documentation is stored in `docs/antora-playbook-local.yml`.

The configuration for the compilation of the online documentation is stored in `docs/antora-playbook.yml`.


== Compiling the Documentation

=== Setup Local Documentation Deployment

Move to the documentation folder: `cd /docs/`.

Install Node dependencies: `npm install`.

To compile the documentation locally, run `npx antora antora-playbook-local.yml`

Inspect the compiled documentation by opening `<...>/ddm/docs/build/index.html` in
your preferred browser.


=== Automatically Updating Screenshots

The included screenshots can be automatically updated using https://pypi.org/project/selenium/[selenium].

==== Set up Selenium

For this to work, install the selenium Python package in your venv (`pip install selenium`).

Next, install a required driver to interface with a browser (different browsers will need different drivers.).
For Windows and Firefox, this process looks as follows:

1. Download the required driver to your device (in the case of Firefox, this is https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases[_geckodriver_]).

2. Move the downloaded driver to a location on your device, where you do not accidentally delete it
(e.g., _C:\Users\username\.geckodriver\_).

3. Add this location to your PATH (Win+S and search for "environment variables" for your account) and add
"C:\Users\username\.geckodriver\" to the list of path variables.

4. Restart your terminal/IDE and run `geckodriver --version` to see whether the driver installation was successful.

==== Run Selenium Script
