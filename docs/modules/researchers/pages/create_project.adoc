This page demonstrates how to create a new Donation Project.


== Project List

When you access DDM, you will see a list of all your Donation Projects:

[.text-center]
.Project List

To create a new data donation project, click on `+ Create New Project`.

== Set up a New Project

When creating a new project, you will see this page:

[.text-center]
.Project Create Form
image::project_create.png["Project Create Form Screenshot", 90%]

On this page, you define the following settings (you can
also modify most of the settings once the project has been created):

Project Name:: Name of the project. Visible to participants in the browser's title bar or a page's tab.

URL Identifier:: Identifier that is included in the URL through which participants can access the project (e.g, https://root.url/project-slug).

Contact Information:: Contact information of the researcher responsible for the project.
Is linked in the footer of the donation interface and can be viewed by data donors at any stage of the data donation process.

Data Protection Statement:: Data protection statement that describes how the data is processed.
Is linked in the footer of the donation interface and can be viewed by data donors at any stage of the data donation process.

Super Secret:: When creating a "super secret" project, you will have to provide
a project password, which will be used to encrypt all collected data donations and survey responses
(for more information on how collected data is encrypted, see xref:developers:topics/encryption.adoc[here]).
This password will not be saved by the application, and the data collected for
this project can only be encrypted by entering the password that was used as a super secret
when the project was created.
Please note that there is no way to recover or reset this password if it is lost.
Furthermore, also note that making a project "super secret" will limit the
functionality of the module: it wonâ€™t be possible to create followup questions based on the data donation
(i.e., data points from the data donation cannot be referenced in a question).

Once you click on `Create Project` your project will be created and you will be redirected to the
Project Hub of your newly created project.
