Here, you can find all options to reset or delete the data collected in a project.

== Reset Project Data
With this option, you can delete all data collected for a given project.


== Delete Specific Participant
You can delete the data for a specific participant by providing their external participation id.

[TIP]
====
You can show your participants their external participation id (also referred to
as _public_id_) during the study (e.g., embedded in a _text block_ as part
of the questionnaire or on the debriefing page) and inform them that by providing their public ID they can
request the deletion of their data in the future if they change their mind.

This function can then help you to delete a participant from the database (if your
study is still ongoing at the time a participant requests the deletion of their
data).
====


== Delete Project
With this option you can delete the current project including all its components (e.g., Uploaders, Blueprints,
Instructions, Questions etc.). This will also delete all associated data.
