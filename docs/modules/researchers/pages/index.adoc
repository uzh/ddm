This part of the documentation is targeted at researchers who want to set up a data donation project using DDM.

== Overview
DDM consists of an _Admin Interface_ and a _Participation Interface_.

=== Admin Interface
Through the Admin Interface, researchers can create and manage data donation projects.
It essentially provides a website to adjust the settings of the project in general
as well as the settings affecting the Participation Interface. To give a first impression of how the Admin Interface
looks, you see below a screenshot of the Project Hub, the main page through which you can configure a project:

=== Participation Interface
The Participation Interface is directed at participants. It includes the pages that participants of a data donation study
will see when taking part in a data donation project. The participation interface usually consists of four steps:

1. A briefing page,
2. the data donation page,
3. a questionnaire, and
4. a debriefing page.

Below, these steps are displayed as they will look to the participants.
