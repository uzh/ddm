The data donation can be configured using so-called `Uploaders`, `Instructions`, and `Blueprints`.
An Uploader essentially represents an upload form through which one file can be uploaded (either a ZIP container
or a single file).
For each Uploader, a set of `Instructions` for participants can be created that show how they can access and
upload the requested file.
A Blueprint is used to define what data will be extracted from the file
that participants upload through the Uploader. Each Uploader has one or multiple associated Blueprints (although
if an Uploader expects a single file, only one Blueprint can be associated with it).

To configure the data donation step, go to the xref:researchers:project_hub.adoc[Project Hub] and click on
_Data Donation_ in the Project Configuration section. You can then configure the Uploaders, Instructions, and
Blueprints on the following page:

== Configure Uploader

When creating an Uploader, you have the following configuration options:

Name:: Name of the Uploader. Will be publicly visible to participants in the header of the Uploader on the
data donation page.

Upload Type:: Either "single file" or "zip file" depending on whether your participants are expected to upload
a single file (e.g., CSV or JSON File) or a ZIP-container.

Index:: The position of the Uploader on the data donation page. Uploaders with a
lower index will be displayed closer to the top of the page. This setting only has an effect, if you use
multiple Uploaders in the same project.

All-in-one consent::
By default, participants will be asked to consent to the donation of the data associated with each Blueprint.
If all-in-one consent is enabled, participants will instead be asked to consent to submit
all uploaded data at once. The all-in-one consent question will be displayed at the bottom of the

|===

Associated Blueprints:: The Blueprints associated to this Uploader. Only associated Blueprints will be
applied to the files uploaded through a particular Uploader.


== Configure Instructions

Once an Uploader is created, you can add Instructions to it.
Donation Instructions consist of one or multiple instruction pages.
Instruction pages are displayed as a slide show at the top of the Uploader on the donation page
(see the figures on the xref:researchers:project_configuration/datadonation/datadonation_overview.adoc[data donation overview page]).
For each instruction page, the following can be configured:

Text:: The instruction text displayed to the participants.
Researchers can also upload and include images or gifs to guide
participants through the data donation process in this field (currently, video upload is not supported).
+
[TIP]
====
The participant's external ID is available as a template variable to be included
in the instruction text as follows: `{{ participant_id }}` which will be displayed
to the participant as something like `IPI2wHDWrHODDRKuo8zo101S`. This is
helpful to enable participants to continue the data donation at a later point in time
(e.g., because it can take some time between requesting data takeout and being
able to download it); read xref:topics/continuation.adoc[this section of the documentation] to find out how
this can be done.
====

Index:: The order of the page in the slideshow.

[NOTE]
====
If no instructions are defined for an Uploader, the instruction section will
be hidden in the participation view.
====

== Configure Blueprints

When creating a Blueprint, you have the following configuration options:

Name:: Name of the Blueprint. Will be publicly visible to participants.
Therefore, it is important to define a meaningful name (e.g., "Watch History", "Liked Posts" or similar).

Description:: Description of what information the Blueprint will extract from the uploaded file.
If defined, the description will be visible for participants in the data donation step.

Associated Uploader:: The `Uploader` to which the Blueprint is associated.

File path:: Here, the path where the file is expected to be located within a ZIP file is defined.
Only necessary, if the Blueprint is associated to a Uploader that expects a ZIP file.
+
WARNING: If a regex expression matches two files, DDM extracts the first one that matches the expression.
Afterward, it does not look any further, even if the matched file does not match the expected fields.
Therefore, be careful to choose regex expressions that will only match the expected file.

*Examples for regex paths to match files*

[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Regex
|Description

|`^MyActivities.json`
|Matches a file named `MyActivities.json` that is located at the root of the ZIP file.

|`^SpecificFolder/MyActivities\.json`
|Matches a file named `MyActivities.json` that is located in a folder named `SpecificFolder` in the root of the ZIP file.

|`.*MyActivities\.json`
|Matches file if the filename ends with `MyActivities.json` that can be located anywhere in the ZIP file. Warning: This also matches e.g. `BogusMyAcitivties.json`.

|`(\^MyActivities\.json\|^MeineAktivitäten\.json\|^MieAttivita\.json)`
|Matches a file that is located at the root of the ZIP file and either named `MyActivities.json`, `MeineAktivitäten.json`, or `MieAttivita.json`.
Can be helpful to match the same file in different languages.

that can help you test regex patterns.
====

Expected fields:: The fields that must be contained in the file from which information should be extracted.
If a file does not contain *all* fields defined here, No Information will be extracted. +
Put the field names in double quotes (") and separate them with commas ("Field A", "Field B").
You can also use regular expressions (regex) to match expected fields - for this, you
must enable the `expected field regex matching` option (see below).

Expected field regex matching:: Select if you use a regex expression in the `Expected fields`
setting.

Expected File Format:: The file format of the file from which information should be extracted.
Currently, only JSON and CSV is implemented.

=== JSON specific settings

Extraction Root::

Indicates on which level of the files' data structure information
should be extracted. If you want to extract information contained on the first
level (e.g., `{'field to be extracted': value}`, you can leave this field empty.
If you want to extract data located on a higher level, then you would provide
the path to the parent field of the data you want to extract (e.g., if your json
file is structured like this `{'friends': {'real_friends': [{'name to extract':
name, 'date to extract': date}], 'fake friends': [{'name': name, 'date': date }]}}`
and you want to extract the names and dates of real_friends, you would set the
extraction root to `friends.real_friends`.

=== CSV specific settings

CSV Delimiter:: This field allows you to specify the character that separates values in the
expected CSV file. (e.g., `,`, `;` or `\t`). If left empty, DDM will try to infer the delimiter from the file structure.


=== Extraction Rules

The settings above are used to identify and validate the correct file from which data should be extracted.
When the file validation is successful, the Blueprint will start to extract information from the file.
For this, it uses `Extraction Rules` which will be applied to the file one after another.

The base assumption for the extraction of the data contained in a file is
that you do not want any data. This means that when you configure your extraction rules,
you first have to add a "Keep Field"-rule for each field that you want to keep in your data (see the setting
`Extraction Operator` below).

Execution Order:: The order in which the extraction rules are applied to a file.

Name:: The name of an extraction rule. For internal organisation only.

Field:: The field to which the rule will be applied. This can either be a "normal" string or a
regular expression (regex). If the latter is the case, you must also select `regex field` (below).

Regex field:: Select if you use a regex expression in the `Field` setting of this rule.

Extraction Operator:: Defines the main logic of the extraction step. Below, you see the list of available extraction
operators:
+
[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Extraction Operator
|Description
|Note

|Keep Field
|Keep this field in the uploaded data.
|–

|Equal (==)
|Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given `field` equals the `comparison value`.
|Works for strings, integers, and dates^1^.

|Not Equal (!=)
|Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given `field` does not equal the `comparison value`.
|Works for strings, integers, and dates^1^.

|Greater than (>)
|Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given `field` is greater than the `comparison value`.
|Works for integers and dates^1^. String values are skipped and the row will be kept in the data.

|Smaller than (<)
|Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given `field` is smaller than the `comparison value`.
|Works for integers and dates^1^. String values are skipped and the row will be kept in the data.

|Greater than or equal (>=)
|Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given `field` is greater than or equal to the `comparison value`.
|Works for integers and dates^1^. String values are skipped and the row will be kept in the data.

|Smaller than or equal (<=)
|Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given `field` is smaller than or equal to the `comparison value`.
|Works for integers and dates^1^. String values are skipped and the row will be kept in the data.

|Delete match (regex)
|Delete parts of the value contained in the given `field` that match the given `regular expression (regex)`
      (e.g., if the `regular expression (regex)` = "^Watched " and a field contains the value "Watched video XY" the following
      value will be kept in the uploaded data: "video XY").
|All field values are converted to strings before this operation is applied.

|Replace match (regex)
|Replace parts of the value contained in the given `field` that match the given `regular expression (regex)`
      (e.g., if the `regular expression (regex)` = "[\w-\.]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{2,4}" and
      the `replacement value` = "_anonymized_" and a field contains the value "some text email@address.com" the following
      value will be kept in the uploaded data: "some text _anonymized_").
|All field values are converted to strings before this operation is applied.

|Delete row when match (regex)
|Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given `field` matches the given `regular expression (regex)` (e.g., if
      `regular expression (regex)` = "^Watched " and a field contains the value "Watched video XY"
      the row/entry will be deleted from the uploaded data).
|All field values are converted to strings before this operation is applied.

|===
+
[small]#^1^ Dates are inferred from string values if they are formatted according to ISO, RFC2822, or HTTP standards,
and only if both the field value and the comparison value follow the same format.
Otherwise, the entry will be treated as a regular string.#


Comparison Value:: The value against which the data contained in the indicated field will be compared according
to the selected Extraction Operator.

Replacement Value:: Only required for operation "Replace match (regex)". The value
that will be used as a replacement if the regex pattern matches.
