The data donation page will be displayed to participants after the
xref:project_configuration/briefing.adoc[briefing page].

Before providing more information on the configuration options of the data donation page, it is helpful to get a
first overview from both the participants' and the researchers' perspectives.

== Participants' Perspective

From the *participants' perspective*, this page includes:

- The donation instructions.
- An upload form through which participants can upload their data donation.
- The option to review the uploaded data before giving explicit consent.
- A consent form (or multiple consent forms).

When first accessing the page, it looks as follows:

[.text-center]
.Data Donation Page

In the top part of the data donation page the participants see the instructions on how to download the file you want
them to download.

Below in the middle is the upload form (the so-called `Uploader` â€“ see <add where to see>) where the
participants will upload their data file.

At the bottom is a description of the data that will be extracted from the uploaded file
(each line corresponds to one `Blueprint`).

Once a participant uploads a file, the page will look as follows:

[.text-center]
.Data Donation Page After Upload
image::datadonation_after_upload_page.png["Data Donation Page After Upload Screenshot", 95%]

Now, the participant can see the extracted data (for each File Blueprint) and decide case by case
whether to submit these data to the researcher.


== Researchers' Perspective

From *the researchers' perspective*, the purpose of the data donation page is to:

1. Providing participants with instructions.
2. Providing participants the possibility to upload their donation.
3. Verify that the participant uploads the correct data.
4. Clean and filter the data that participants upload according to pre-defined extraction rules.
5. Provide the participant the possibility to review the cleansed and filtered data before data transmission.
6. Obtain informed consent from participants.

These steps take all place on the participants devices and no personal data leave the participants' devices before they
provide their consent and click on "transmit data" (see xref: to learn more about how DDM's data processing).

The next pages will guide you through how you can configure the data donation step.
