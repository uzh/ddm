The debriefing page is the last part of your project, that participants will see and interact with.
The purpose of the debriefing page is to debrief participant and possibly reroute them to the
next part of your study (e.g., by redirecting to an external questionnaire).

== Participants' Perspective

To the participants, the debriefing page will look something like this:

[.text-center]
.Debriefing Page
image::debriefing_page.png["Debriefing Page Screenshot",95%]


== Configuration Options

You can access the configuration options for the briefing page in _Project Hub > Project Configuration > Debriefing_.
To configure the debriefing page, you have the following option:

Debriefing text:: Text displayed to participants on the debriefing page.

[TIP]
====
Sometimes you might want to display different debriefing texts depending on the
previous actions of your participant (e.g., if a participant did indicate that
they do not want to take part in the study, or if a participant did not attempt
to donate any data).

For this, you can make use of the templating engine and, for example, define the
following debriefing page that displays a different text to a participant that
did not attempt to donate any that compared to a participant who donated at least
some data (the example assumes that two donations were expected in this study):

{% if donation_info.n_success > 0 %}
Dear participant,

Thank you very much for participating in our study. With your data donation, you
made a great contribution towards advancing our understanding of algorithmic
selection on the internet.
{% endif %}

{% if donation_info.n_pending == 2 %}
Dear participant,

Thank you for your time. Because you did not attempt to donate any data, you are
unfortunately not eligible to receive the participation reward.
{% endif %}
