Depending on the question type, different configuration options are available.

== General Settings

The following configuration settings are available for all question types:

Name:: A question name. This name is only used for internal organisation and is not visible to participants.

Blueprint:: A question can either be _general_ or related to a
xref:researchers:project_configuration/datadonation/datadonation_configuration.adoc[_Blueprint_].
+
*General questions* are displayed to all participants, regardless if they successfully
donated any data. +
*Questions related to a Blueprint* are only displayed to those participants
that successfully uploaded some data to the related file blueprint.
This means that if no donated data were extracted by the related Blueprint (either because the
extraction _failed_, _was not attempted_ or _all entries were filtered out by the extraction rules_),
the question will not be displayed.
+
Consult the section on xref:researchers:project_configuration/questionnaire/questionnaire_data_integration.adoc[
integrating donated data in the questionnaire] for more information.

Page:: Number of the page on which the question will be displayed.

Index:: Order in which questions on the same page will be displayed.

Variable Name:: The variable name associated to a question. This name will be included
in the data export. For items belonging to a question, the variable name will
be constructed as follows: "question_variable_name-+{item-value+}".

Text:: The question text that is displayed to participants.

Required:: If a question is marked as required, the application will show a
hint to the participant if they forgot to answer this question.
This hint will only be shown once. This means that if a participant chooses to
ignore the hint and clicks on 'continue', they are able to skip a required question.

Randomize items:: Enable or disable randomization of *all* items.

== Specific Settings

=== Question Items

For Single Choice Questions, Multiple Choice Questions, Matrix Questions and Semantic Differentials,
participants answer in relation to question items. To configure question items, the following
settings are available:

Label:: The label/text of the item that is displayed to participants related to an item.
For semantic differential questions, this is the label displayed on the left-hand side of the scale.

Label alt:: Only for semantic differential questions: the label displayed on the
right-hand side of the scale.

Index:: Defines the order in which the items are displayed.

Value:: Is (_a_) the identifier of an item and (_b_) used to indicate which
item(s) has or have been selected in the data export (only for Single and Multi
Choice Questions).

Randomize:: Instead of randomizing the order of all items with the _randomize_ setting
on the question level, this setting allows randomizing only certain items while
those for which this option is not ticked stay in their place (i.e., according to
their index).

Delete:: Tick this box if the item should be deleted. The item will be deleted
as soon as you click on _Update Items_.


=== Scale Configuration

For Matrix Questions and Semantic Differentials, participants give their answers (or in other words: rate
the question items) with the configured question scale.

Index:: Defines the order in which the items are displayed.

Label:: The label/text that is displayed to participants associated to the scale point.

Value:: Used to indicate which scale point has been selected in the data export.

Add border:: Setting currently has no effect - Still need to be implemented.

Delete:: Tick this box if the scale point should be deleted. The scale point
will be deleted as soon as you click on _Update Scale Points_.
