From the Project Hub, you can access all settings and information that are relevant for your data donation project.
It consists of four main areas:


1. *Project Details*: General settings for your project.

2. *Project Configuration*: Here, you can configure each step that your participants will go through when taking
part in your project.

3. *Data Center*: Here, you can download the collected data, access your project's logs, and find some general
participation statistics.
// TODO: Add link to, e.g., project's logs.

4. *Danger Zone*: Here, you find options to delete the project, the project's data, or the data belonging to specific
participants.
