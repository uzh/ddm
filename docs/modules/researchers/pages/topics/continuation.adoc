Oftentimes, it can take some time between requesting a data takeout from a
platform and actually being able to download this takeout. Therefore, researchers
might want to provide their study participants with the possibility to pause their
participation and continue with the study as soon as they were able to download
their personal data takeout.

To enable this, DDM offers a continuation endpoint through which participants
can resume their participation. This endpoint is a URL containing the project
url identifier as well as the external participant ID passed as a URL parameter
`p`. This URL looks as follows:
`https://your-domain.com/project-slug/continue?p=ExternalParticipantID`

[TIP]
====
You can display this continuation link in the instructions to your participants
by utilizing the Django templating functionality
(xref:for_researchers.adoc#_participant_related_data[described here])
as follows:
`https.//your-domain.com/project-slug/continue?p={{ participant.public_id }}`
