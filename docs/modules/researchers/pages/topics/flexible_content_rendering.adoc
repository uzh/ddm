= Templating Features

Certain text fields in DDM provide researchers with templating features that enhance the flexibility and control in displaying specific information to participants. These templating features are available in the briefing text, the debriefing text, instruction texts, as well as in question texts and item texts for questions that are connected to a Donation Blueprint. In these fields, you can tailor which and how data is shown to participants based on certain conditions, such as whether a participant has successfully donated their data or has skipped the donation step. By using so-called _template tags_, _template filters_, and _template variables_, you can create dynamic and personalized content that adapts to different scenarios, ensuring the information presented is both relevant and clear.

WARNING: This is an advanced feature. Use the templating features with caution. Misspecifications of tags and filters can lead to errors that will interrupt the flow for participants and can even break the application by causing a server error (502). We therefore advise to always thoroughly test templates including any tags, filters, or variables.

== Available Tags and Filters
Below, you find information on which variables, tags, and filters are available.

=== Available Variables
In all fields where the template features are available, the following variables can be used:

- `participant_id`: The external ID of the participant.
- `url_parameter`: A dictionary containing the URL parameters extracted from the initial URL. For example, this variable could look like `{'url_param_a': <value A>, 'url_param_b': <value B>}` and you would access a specific value by including `{{ url_paramerer.url_param_a }}` in your text field.
- `donation_info`: A dictionary containing information on the status of a participant's donation. Contains the following information which can be included in a text field as `{{ donation_info.n_success }}`:

[source]
----
"donation_info": {
    "n_success": 1,           # number of successfully uploaded blueprints by this participant (regardless of consent).
    "n_pending": 1,           # number of pending (i.e., not attempted) blueprint uploads.
    "n_failed": 0,            # number of blueprints where an upload was attempted but failed.
    "n_consent": 1,           # number of successful uploads to which donation consent was given.
    "n_no_consent": 0,        # number of successful uploads to which no donation consent was given.
    "n_no_data_extracted": 0  # number of donations by this participant where all entries were filtered out
}
----

Additionally, in questions related to a specific Donation Blueprint, you can access the data that a participant has uploaded for this specific Blueprint in the question text and item texts:

- `donated_data`: The data uploaded by the participant for a specific Blueprint.

==== Usage
Variables can be used by including them in double curly brackets in the text field. For example, in the debriefing text you could write: `This is your personal participation ID: {{ participant_id }}.` which would then be presented to a participant as "This is your personal participation ID: 123456789."

=== Tags
The following template tags are supported:

- `{% if %}`/`{% elif %}`/`{% else %}`/`{% endif %}`: Conditional rendering to include content based on a true/false statement (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#if[more information]).
- `{% for %}`/`{% endfor %}`: Iteration over a sequence to render content multiple times (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#for[more information]).
- `{% ifchanged %}`/`{% else %}`/`{% endifchanged %}`: Checks if a value has changed compared to the last iteration of a for-loop (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#ifchanged[more information]).
- `{% regroup %}`: Use to regroup a consistently structured list (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#regroup[more information]).

==== Usage
Template tags can be used by enclosing them in `{% <...> %}`. For example, on the debriefing page, you could write:

[source]
----
{% if donation_info.n_consent == 0 %}Unfortunately, you did not donate any data.{% else %}Thank you very much for donationg your data!{% endif %}
----

If a person has agreed to donate at least some of their data, they will see the following on the debriefing page:
"Thank you very much for donating your data!". Note that for most tags it is important to close them (in the example by including `{% endif %}`), otherwise an error occurs and the text will not be rendered at all.

For more details and examples, see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/language/#tags.

=== Filters
The following template filters can be used to modify the output of variables:

- `date`: Formats a date according to the given format string (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#date[more information]).
- `default`:  Provides a default value if the variable evaluates to False (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#default[more information]).
- `dictsort:"var"`: Sorts a list of dictionaries by the provided variable (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#dictsort[more information]).
- `dictsortreversed:"var"`: Sorts a list of dictionaries by the provided variable in reversed order (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#dictsortreversed[more information]).
- `first`: Returns the first item in a list (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#first[more information]).
- `last`: Returns the last item in a list (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#last[more information]).
- `length`: The length of a value (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#length[more information]).
- `random`: Returns a random item from the given list (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#random[more information]).
- `truncatechars:n_chars`: Truncates a string after a specified number of characters (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#truncatechars[more information]).
- `truncatewords:n_words`: Truncates a string after a specified number of words (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#truncatewords[more information]).


==== Usage
Template filters can be used by adding them to a value (which can also be a variable) as follows: `{{ value|filter }}`. For example, `{{ "abcde"|truncatechars:3 }}` will render as "abcâ€¦".

For more details and examples, see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/language/#filters.

== Technical Implementation
We have extended the default Django Template Engine to create a tailored version that supports a subset of the full range of template tags and filters implemented in Django. This customized engine allows for enhanced control over which features are available to users, focusing on simplicity and security while maintaining core template functionality.

Limiting the available template tags and filters, ensures security and performance while maintaining essential template functionalities and providing customization and flexibility to users.
