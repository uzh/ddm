Certain text fields in DDM provide researchers with templating features that enhance the flexibility and control in
displaying specific information to participants. These templating features are available in the briefing text,
the debriefing text, instruction texts, as well as in question texts and item texts for questions that are connected to
a xref:researchers:project_configuration/datadonation/datadonation_overview.adoc[Blueprint]. In these fields, you can
tailor which and how data is shown to participants based on certain
conditions, such as whether a participant has successfully donated their data or has skipped the donation step.
By using so-called _template tags_, _template filters_, and _template variables_, you can create dynamic and personalized
content that adapts to different scenarios, ensuring the information presented is both relevant and clear.

WARNING: This is an advanced feature. Use the templating features with caution. Misspecifications of tags and filters
can lead to errors that will interrupt the flow for participants and can even break the application by causing a server
error (502). We therefore advise to always thoroughly test templates including any tags, filters, or variables.

== Available Tags and Filters
Below, you find information on which variables, tags, and filters are available.

=== Available Variables
In all fields where the template features are available, the following variables can be used:

- `participant_id`: The external ID of the participant.
- `url_parameter`: A dictionary containing the URL parameters extracted from the initial URL. For example,
this variable could look like `{'url_param_a': <value A>, 'url_param_b': <value B>}` and you would access a specific
value by including `{{ url_paramerer.url_param_a }}` in your text field.
- `briefing_consent`: If you
xref:researchers:project_configuration/briefing.adoc#_configuration_options[enable the briefing consent on the Briefing page],
this variable will be `1` if participant has
consented to participation and `0` otherwise. If you have not enabled briefing consent, then
this will be `None`.
- `donation_info`: A dictionary containing information on the status of a participant's donation. Contains the following
information which can be included in a text field as `{{ donation_info.n_success }}`:

[source]
----
"donation_info": {
    "n_success": 1,           # number of successfully uploaded blueprints by this participant (regardless of consent).
    "n_pending": 1,           # number of pending (i.e., not attempted) blueprint uploads.
    "n_failed": 0,            # number of blueprints where an upload was attempted but failed.
    "n_consent": 1,           # number of successful uploads to which donation consent was given.
    "n_no_consent": 0,        # number of successful uploads to which no donation consent was given.
    "n_no_data_extracted": 0  # number of donations by this participant where all entries were filtered out
}
----

Additionally, in questions related to a specific Donation Blueprint, you can access the data that a participant has
uploaded for this specific Blueprint in the question text and item texts:

- `donated_data`: The data uploaded by the participant for a specific Blueprint.

==== Usage
Variables can be used by including them in double curly brackets in the text field. For example, in the debriefing text
you could write: `This is your personal participation ID: {{ participant_id }}.` which would then be presented to a
participant as "This is your personal participation ID: 123456789."

=== Tags
The following template tags are supported:

- `{% if %}`/`{% elif %}`/`{% else %}`/`{% endif %}`: Conditional rendering to include content based on a true/false
statement (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#if[more information]).
- `{% for %}`/`{% endfor %}`: Iteration over a sequence to render content multiple times
(https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#for[more information]).
- `{% ifchanged %}`/`{% else %}`/`{% endifchanged %}`: Checks if a value has changed compared to the last iteration of
a for-loop (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#ifchanged[more information]).
- `{% regroup %}`: Use to regroup a consistently structured list (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#regroup[more information]).

==== Usage
Template tags can be used by enclosing them in `{% <...> %}`. For example, on the debriefing page, you could write:

[source]
----
{% if donation_info.n_consent == 0 %}Unfortunately, you did not donate any data.{% else %}Thank you very much for
donationg your data!{% endif %}
----

If a person has agreed to donate at least some of their data, they will see the following on the debriefing page:
"Thank you very much for donating your data!". Note that for most tags it is important to close them (in the example
by including `{% endif %}`), otherwise an error occurs and the text will not be rendered at all.

For more details and examples, see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/language/#tags.

=== Filters
The following template filters can be used to modify the output of variables:

- `date`: Formats a date according to the given format string (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#date[more information]).
- `default`:  Provides a default value if the variable evaluates to False (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#default[more information]).
- `dictsort:"var"`: Sorts a list of dictionaries by the provided variable (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#dictsort[more information]).
- `dictsortreversed:"var"`: Sorts a list of dictionaries by the provided variable in reversed order (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#dictsortreversed[more information]).
- `first`: Returns the first item in a list (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#first[more information]).
- `last`: Returns the last item in a list (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#last[more information]).
- `length`: The length of a value (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#length[more information]).
- `random`: Returns a random item from the given list (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#random[more information]).
- `truncatechars:n_chars`: Truncates a string after a specified number of characters (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#truncatechars[more information]).
- `truncatewords:n_words`: Truncates a string after a specified number of words (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/builtins/#truncatewords[more information]).


==== Usage
Template filters can be used by adding them to a value (which can also be a variable) as follows: `{{ value|filter }}`.
For example, `{{ "abcde"|truncatechars:3 }}` will render as "abcâ€¦".

For more details and examples, see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/language/#filters.

=== Use Cases

==== Different Debriefing Pages Depending on Participation Success

You may want to display a different debriefing text to participants that do not provide initial
consent for participation. In this case you would use the following in the text configuration of
your debriefing page:

[source]
--
Dear participant I would like to tell you something about yourself.

{% if briefing_consent == "1" %}
You did consent to take part in this study and for this we are really grateful.
{% else %}
Unfortunately, you did not consent to take part in the study but we respect your
decision and completely understand! :')
{% endif %}

Your public ID is as follows: "{{ participant_id }}". Please take a photo
of this ID. If you wnat to request the deletion of your data at some point in the
future you can send an e-mail with your personal public ID to someone@mail.com
and your data will be deleted from our servers.
--

A participant that consented to take part in the study will then see this question as
follows:

[source]
--
Dear participant I would like to tell you something about yourself.

You did consent to take part in this study and for this we are really grateful.

Your public ID is as follows: "xHQVbrYUYXn5lklW3RGSeouX". Please take a photo
of this ID. If you wnat to request the deletion of your data at some point in the
future you can send an e-mail with your personal public ID to someone@mail.com
and your data will be deleted from our servers.
--


==== Display First Element of List in Data Donation

Assuming you collect data donations from your participants that lead to the following data structure:

[source]
--
[
    {'title': 'First Title', 'timestamp': '2022-12-19T08:49:18'},
    {'title': 'Second Title', 'timestamp': '2022-12-16T11:43:02'},
    # ...
]
--

When you want to display the title of the first element of that list in a question text, you can do this by specifying
the question text as follows:

[source]
--
This is the title of the last video you watched on YouTube: "{{ donated_data.0.title }}"

Please indicate below, why you watched this video.
--

This will then be rendered as follows:

[source]
--
This is the title of the last video you watched on YouTube: "First Title"

Please indicate below, why you watched this video.
--

[TIP]
====
If you are starting to construct a dynamic question text, first include the
complete data objects stored in the variables in your question text (e.g.,
`{{ participant }}, {{ data }}`).

Next, open the link to your study in an anonymous browser window and go through
the steps until you reach the questionnaire part. This way you can see how the
data object is structured and figure out from there, how you can access the
information on deeper levels of the data structure. You can then start to adjust
the variables and reload the anonymous window every time you made a change to the
question definition to see how your new specification will be rendered.

== Technical Implementation
We have extended the default Django Template Engine to create a tailored version that supports a subset of the full
range of template tags and filters implemented in Django. This customized engine allows for enhanced control over which
features are available to users, focusing on simplicity and security while maintaining core template functionality.

Limiting the available template tags and filters, ensures security and performance while maintaining essential template
functionalities and providing customization and flexibility to users.
