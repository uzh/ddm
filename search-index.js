For System Administrators DDM is a web application that builds on Django, a Python web framework. Therefore, to run DDM you first need to install Python (3.8 or newer) and Django 3.2. For the installation of Python, please go to the official Python website: python.org The installation of Django is described in the next section. If you are planning to install DDM for production use, we advise to follow a comprehensive tutorial such as the one provided by Digital Ocean. To install Django and DDM, we strongly advise to use a new virtual environment (venv) for the installation. To create a new venv, run the following command in the folder where you want your installation to be located (the commands listed here should work for Linux and macOS; for other setups see here). ProjectPath> python -m venv /path/to/venv Then you can activate the environment as follows: ProjectPath> source /path/to/venv/bin/activate (venv) ProjectPath> Next, install Django in your virtual environment: (venv) ProjectPath> pip install Django==3.2.* Now that Django is installed, start a new project and access it: (venv) ProjectPath> django-admin startproject yourproject (venv) ProjectPath> cd yourproject This will create a new folder yourproject that contains a file called manage.py and a folder that is also called yourproject. In this subfolder you will find, among others, the settings.py and the urls.py file. Next, create a superuser account with your Django project: (venv) ProjectPath/yourproject> python manage.py createsuperuser You will be asked to provide a username and a password. To see whether the installation of Django worked run the following command and see whether the base site loads: (venv) ProjectPath/yourproject> python manage.py runserver Install the Django DDM package: (venv) ProjectPath/yourproject> pip install django-ddm Next, you will have to adjust several sections of your settings.py and urls.py files. First, add the necessary entries to INSTALLED_APPS in your settings.py: # settings.py INSTALLED_APPS = [ # ..., 'ddm', 'ckeditor', 'ckeditor_uploader', 'webpack_loader', 'rest_framework', 'rest_framework.authtoken', ] Add the following configuration for webpack-loader to your settings.py: # settings.py WEBPACK_LOADER = { 'DEFAULT': { 'CACHE': True, 'BUNDLE_DIR_NAME': 'ddm/vue/', 'STATS_FILE': os.path.join(STATIC_ROOT, 'ddm/vue/webpack-stats.json'), 'POLL_INTERVAL': 0.1, 'IGNORE': [r'.+\\.hot-update.js', r'.+\\.map'], } } Add the DDM context processor to your template context processors. This will enable the version indicator of the currently used DDM distribution below the header in the admin interface. # settings.py TEMPLATES = [ { 'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates', 'DIRS': ['templates'], 'APP_DIRS': True, 'OPTIONS': { 'context_processors': [ # ... 'ddm.context_processors.add_ddm_version' # Add this. ], }, }, ] Configure CKEditor settings in your settings.py to allow your users to upload images and gifs in instructions and question texts: # settings.py CKEDITOR_RESTRICT_BY_USER = True # Files uploaded by one user can only be accessed by this particular user CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_PATH = 'uploads/' Add time zone support to your settings.py: # settings.py USE_TZ = True Optionally, an e-mail address restriction can be defined in settings.py. Only users whose e-mail address matches the defined regex pattern will be allowed to set up data donation projects: # settings.py DDM_SETTINGS = { 'EMAIL_PERMISSION_CHECK': r'.*(\\.|@)somedomain\\.com$', }, Include the DDM urls in your projects urls.py: # urls.py urlpatterns = [ # ... path('ddm/', include('ddm.urls')), ] Configure login and logout endpoints for DDM in urls.py: # urls.py urlpatterns = [ ... path('ddm/', include('ddm.urls')), path('login/', auth_views.LoginView.as_view(template_name='ddm/admin/auth/login.html'), name='ddm-login'), # You can choose whatever path and template you like path('logout/', auth_views.LogoutView.as_view(), name='ddm-logout'), # You can choose whatever path and template you like ] If you use DDM on a Django site together with wagtail and you have internationalization enabled for your wagtail urls, we recommend to use the prefix_default_language=False for the i18n_patterns: # urls.py urlpatterns += i18n_patterns( path('', include(wagtail_urls)), prefix_default_language=False ) Not doing this will cause ddm.tests.test_apis.test_participant_deletion_with_regular_login to fail. In practice, the participant API still seems to work properly despite the test failing, however, unexpected behaviour cannot be ruled out at this point. This will be fixed in a future version. Furthermore, add the following to your urls.py: # urls.py urlpatterns = [ ... path('ckeditor/', include('ckeditor_uploader.urls')), ] DDM uses a custom CKEditor toolbar for instruction and question text definitions that can optionally be customized (find out more) The Python installation includes SQLite which is configured to be used as a database backend in the standard settings.py created by Django. For a development environment, this SQLite is totally fine, however for a production deployment you should consider configuring a more robust and efficient database such as PostgreSQL or MariaDB (see the Django Documentation for further information). Once you have configured a database, run python manage.py migrate to create the ddm models in your database. To test if your installation was successful, run python manage.py test ddm. Next, run python manage.py runserver to start the server locally. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin to ensure that the Data Donation Module is listed as a subsection in the administration interface. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ddm/projects to see whether you can access the ddm project overview site and try to create a new project. You can provide default images to be included in the header of the participation views. These images will be displayed by default, but can be overwritten on a project-basis by researchers in the project settings. To enable default images, provide the paths to the images that you want to display in the left and/or right part of the public header in your settings.py as follows: # settings.py DDM_DEFAULT_HEADER_IMG_LEFT = '/path/to/logo_left.png' DDM_DEFAULT_HEADER_IMG_RIGHT = '/path/to/logo_right.png' Official Django Documentation Official Python Documentation Django Tutorials on W3Schools or Digital Ocean Information for developers in this documentation","title":"Documentation for System Administrators","component":"ddm","version":"v1.0.0","name":"for_admins","url":"/ddm/v1.0.0/for_admins.html","titles":[{"text":"Getting Started","hash":"_getting_started","id":1},{"text":"Install Django","hash":"_install_django","id":2},{"text":"Install DDM","hash":"_install_ddm","id":3},{"text":"Update Settings.py","hash":"_update_settings_py","id":4},{"text":"Update urls.py","hash":"_update_urls_py","id":5},{"text":"Apply Database Migrations","hash":"_apply_database_migrations","id":6},{"text":"Test Installation","hash":"_test_installation","id":7},{"text":"Optional Settings","hash":"_optional_settings","id":8},{"text":"Default Header Images","hash":"_default_header_images","id":9},{"text":"Further Resources","hash":"_further_resources","id":10}]},"2":{"id":2,"text":"DDM For Developers The repository includes a django test project that can be used for local development and testing. Once you have cloned or forked the GitHub repository, activate your local virtual environment and install the following requirements: (venv) SomePath/ddm> pip install -r requirements.txt A basic standard configuration for the test project is specified in test_project/test_config.json. Adjust the information in this file if you want to use a custom setup, or use another database. By default, the test project uses SQLite as a database backend. If you do make changes to this file, please do NOT commit these changes to the shared repository. Through the setup described above, the regular django commands are now available: To start the development server use the following commands: (venv) SomePath/ddm/test_project> python manage.py runserver To create new migrations based on the changes made to the models, run: (venv) SomePath/ddm/test_project> python manage.py makemigrations To apply existing migrations to your local database, run: [1] (venv) SomePath/ddm/test_project> python manage.py migrate To run unit tests, use: (venv) SomePath/ddm/test_project> python manage.py test ddm To run the app in development mode, you will need to serve both Django’s dev server and the webpack development server. From the frontend directory, run: (venv) SomePath/ddm/frontend> npm run serve And, in a separate terminal in the Django root directory, run the Django development server: (venv) SomePath/ddm/test_project> python manage.py runserver Open your locally hosted Django app in a browser (e.g. http://localhost:8000). When it is time to deploy, or when you simply want to omit running the Vue dev server, you can build the Vue project in production mode. Cancel the npm run serve process if it is running and instead run npm run build. The optimized bundles will be built in and placed into the Django static file location, and webpack-stats.json will be updated to reflect this new configuration. The vue builds should end up in the static folder of the django module (ddm/static). This project uses GitHub actions for automated testing and CI tasks. A push to develop triggers build tests for the following configurations: Python: [3.8, 3.10.4] Database: [sqlite, mysql] A tag (vX.X.X) push to develop triggers build tests (see above). If the tests are successful develop is automatically merged into main. Please make sure that pushed tags are in sync with package versions on PyPi. If the build-tests of a pushed tag fail, delete the tag[2] and push the fixed version again with the same tag until the tests run through. A push to main triggers build tests and if the tests are successful, automatically bumps the version number (patch number) and builds a new PyPi package. The tests have the same configurations as on develop. A pull request to main created by dependabot will automatically update the affected dependencies and merge into main. A regular push to develop triggers the following pipeline: Run tests on develop. Create new documentation for GitHub pages. A tag (\"vX.X.X\") push to develop triggers the following pipeline: Run tests on develop. Create new documentation for GitHub pages. Merge develop into main. Run tests on main. Create PyPi package. A pull request to main created by dependabot triggers the following pipeline: Update dependencies. Merge into main. Run tests on main. Create PyPi package. A new release is created manually and includes: Bumping the minor or major part of the version. Updating setup.cfg. Ideally, add a changelog.

How to monitor an ongoing data donation project. How to download and work with the collected data. It is assumed that a server with DDM set up on it is running. Readers interested in setting up a server to run DDM for institutional use or their own research should turn to the Documentation for Administrators. For a general introduction to the module, see this page. To set up a new data donation project, got to the /projects/ page and click on \"+ Create New Project\". On the project creation page, you will be presented with the following options to configure your project: Project Name Name of the project. Visible to participants in the browser’s title bar or a page’s tab. URL Identifier Identifier that is included in the URL through which participants can access the project (e.g, https://root.url/project-slug). Contact Information Contact information of the researcher responsible for the project. Is linked in the footer of the donation interface and can be viewed by data donors at any stage of the data donation process. Data Protection Statement Data protection statement that describes how the data is processed. Is linked in the footer of the donation interface and can be viewed by data donors at any stage of the data donation process. Super Secret When creating a \"super secret\" project, you will have to provide a project password, which will be used to encrypt all collected data donations and survey responses (for more information on how collected data is encrypted, see here). This password will not be saved by the application, and the data collected for this project can only be encrypted by entering the password that was used as a super secret when the project was created. Please note that there is no way to recover or reset this password if it is lost. Furthermore, also note that making a project \"super secret\" will limit the functionality of the module: it won’t be possible to create followup questions based on the data donation (i.e., data points from the data donation cannot be referenced in a question). Once a project is created, you will be redirected to the \"Project Hub\". From here, you can access all settings and information that are relevant for your data donation project. It consists of four main areas: Project Details Project Configuration Data Center Danger Zone Project Name Name of the project. Visible to participants in the browser’s title bar or a page’s tab. External Project Slug Identifier that is used to expose the project to participants (e.g, https://root.url/project-slug ). Contact Information Contact information of the researcher responsible for the project. Is linked in the footer of the donation interface and can be viewed by data donors at any stage of the data donation process. Data Protection Statement Data protection statement that describes how the data is processed. Is linked in the footer of the donation interface and can be viewed by data donors at any stage of the data donation process. Optionally, information can be extracted from parameters passed with the URL when a project is accessed by a participant. This can be configured using the following settings: URL parameter extraction enabled Enable or disable whether URL parameters should be extracted when participants access the project’s briefing page. Expected URL parameter Provide a string containing the parameters that should be extracted. Separate multiple parameters with a semikolon (e.g., \"parameter_A;parameter_B\"). The extracted values will be saved for each participant and is included in the data export. If a parameter is not present, it will be saved as None. Undefined parameters passed in the URL will be ignored. If participants are asked to first fill out a questionnaire created in an external survey software such as e.g. Unipark or Qualtrics, passing URL parameters can be used to link data donations with the survey data by passing a participant ID in the URL parameters. Optionally, participants can be redirected to another website from the debriefing page. This can be configured using the following settings: Redirect enabled Enable or disable the redirection of your participants when they have completed your project. If enabled, a redirect button will be displayed on the data donation end page that redirects to the URL defined in the Redirect target setting. Redirect target URL to which participants will redirected (only required if redirect is enabled). The redirect URL can include information on the participant and the project ID. For this, you can use variables that are populated with the respective values. Currently, the following variables are supported: The participant data is accessible with {{ participant }} and the project ID can be inserted with {{ project_id }}. E.g., https://redirect.url?param={{participant.data.url_param.URLParameter}}&participant={{participant.public_id}}&project={{project_id}} See this section for more information on the {{ participant }}-variable. The following settings are available to customize the appearance of your data donation project: Header Image Left/Header Image Right Upload an image that will be displayed in the header of your project (e.g., an institution or project logo). The structure of the Project Configuration follows the steps of the prototypical data donation process. It consists of the following sections: Welcome Page: Define what is displayed to participants when they enter your project. Data Donation: Define the expected data donations, extraction rules, and donation instructions. Questionnaire: Define questions that will be shown to participants after they have donated their data. End Page: Define what is displayed when participants reach the end of the data donation. Briefing Text Text displayed to participants on the briefing page. in the briefing text, you can make use of dynamic template functionalities. You can read more about how to use dynamic templates here. Briefing Consent Mandatory If briefing consent is enabled, participants will have to explicitly indicate their consent at the bottom of the briefing page before they can continue. If a participant does indicate that they to do not consent, they will be redirected to the debriefing page. Briefing consent label yes/Briefing consent label no The labels displayed to participants to indicate consent (\"briefing consent label yes\") or reject consent (\"briefing consent label no\"). The data donation is organized in File Uploaders and Donation Blueprints. A \"File Uploader\" corresponds to the file that is expected to be uploaded. This file can either be a single file (e.g., a JSON file) or a ZIP container. For each File Uploader, a set of Instructions for participants can be defined that describe how they can access and upload the requested file. Each uploader has one or multiple associated Donation Blueprints (although if a File Uploader expects a single file, only one Donation Blueprint can be associated with it). A Donation Blueprint defines how the data contained in a single file (e.g., the uploaded file in the case of a single file upload, or a file contained in the ZIP container in the case of a ZIP upload) is extracted. The data donation step can incorporate multiple File Uploaders. Name Name of the File Uploader. Will be publicly visible to participants in the header of the file uplaoder. Upload Type Either \"single file\" or \"zip file\". Index The position of the file uploader on the data donation page. Only relevant if multiple file uploaders are displayed – file uploaders with a lower index will be displayed closer to the top of the page. Associated Donation Blueprints The donation blueprints that apply to the expected file(s) collected with the file uploader. Donation Instructions consist of one or multiple instruction pages. Instruction pages are displayed as a slide show at the top of file uploader. For each instruction page, the following can be configured: Text The instruction text displayed to the participants. By default, researchers can also upload and include images or gifs to guide participants through the data donation process in this field (currently, video upload is not supported). The participant’s external ID is available as a template variable to be included in the instruction text as follows: {{ participant_id }} which will be displayed to the participant as something like IPI2wHDWrHODDRKuo8zo101S. This is helpful to enable participants to continue the data donation at a later point in time (e.g., because it can take some time between requesting data takeout and being able to download it); read this section of the documentation to find out how this can be done. Index The position of the page in the slideshow. NOTE If no instructions are defined for a File Uploader, the instruction section will be hidden in the participation view. Name Name of the expected data donations. Will be publicly visible to participants. Therefore, it is important to define a meaningful name. Description Description of what the blueprint will extract. If defined, the description will be visible for participants in the data donation step. Associated File Uploader The File Uploader for which the blueprint will be applied. File path Here, the path where the file is expected to be located within a ZIP file is defined. Only necessary, if the Donation Blueprint is part of a Blueprint Container. If a regex expression matches two files, DDM extracts the first one that matches the expression. Afterwards, it does not look any further, even if the matched file does not match the expected fields. Therefore, be careful to choose regex expressions that will only match the expected file. Examples for regex paths to match files Regex Description ^MyActivities.json Matches a file named MyActivities.json that is located at the root of the ZIP file. ^SpecificFolder/MyActivities\\.json Matches a file named MyActivities.json that is located in a folder named SpecificFolder in the root of the ZIP file. .*MyActivities\\.json Matches file if the filename ends with MyActivities.json that can be located anywhere in the ZIP file. Warning: This also matches e.g. BogusMyAcitivties.json. (^MyActivities\\.json|^MeineAktivitäten\\.json|^MieAttivita\\.json) Matches a file that is located at the root of the ZIP file and either named MyActivities.json, MeineAktivitäten.json, or MieAttivita.json. Can be helpful to match the same file in different languages. You can find about more about regex here. On this website, you will also find some Tools that can help you test regex patterns. Expected fields The fields that must be contained in the donated file. If a file does not contain one or more of the fields defined here, it will not be accepted as a donation. Put the field names in double quotes (\") and separate them with commas (\"Field A\", \"Field B\"). Expected File Format The file format of the expected data donation. Currently, only JSON and CSV is implemented. Extraction Root Indicates on which level of the files' data structure information should be extractet. If you want to extract information contained on the first level (e.g., {'field to be extracted': value}, you can leave this field empty. If you want to extract data located on a higher level, then you would provide the path to the parent field of the data you want to extract (e.g., if your json file is structured like this {'friends': {'real_friends': [{'name to extract': name, 'date to extract': date}], 'fake friends': [{'name': name, 'date': date }]}} and you want to extract the names and dates of real_friends, you would set the extraction root to friends.real_friends. CSV Delimiter The delimiter used in the expected file (e.g., , or ;). If left empty, the used Javascript function will try to infer the delimiter from the file structure. The base assumption for the extraction of the data contained in an uploaded file is that you do not want any data. This means that when you configure your extraction rules, you first have to add a rule for each field that you want to keep in your data. Execution Order The order in which the extraction rules are applied to a file. Name The name of an extraction rule. For internal organisation only. Field The field to which the rule will be applied. Extraction Operator Defines the main logic of the extraction step. If empty, this indicates that you want to keep the field in the donated data. For all non-regex operations, if an operations evaluates to True, the row will be deleted from the donated data (further explanations on the separate rules will follow). Comparison Value The value against which the data contained in the indicated field will be compared according to the selected comparison logic. Replacement Value Only required for operation \"Replace match (regex)\". The value that will be used as a replacement if the regex pattern matches. Researchers can optionally define a questionnaire that is displayed after the data donation. The questionnaire is displayed after the data donation step and consists of one or more pages, each consisting of one or more questions. A question can either be general or be related to a file blueprint. General questions are displayed to all participants, regardless if they successfully donated any data. Questions related to a file blueprint are only displayed to those participants that successfully uploaded some data to the related file blueprint. This means that if the data extraction for a specific file blueprint either fails, is not attempted or zero data entries are extracted because all entries were filtered out, the question will not be displayed. For questions related to a file blueprint, the data extracted by the related blueprint for a given participant is available to be included in the question text (see below for more information on how to include data in question texts). The questionnaire responses are only submitted to the server after all questions have been answered. This means that if a participants aborts the questionnaire after filling out, e.g., 2 out of 4 questions, no responses will be collected and saved on the server. Currently, the following question types are implemented: Single Choice Question Multi Choice Question Matrix Question Semantic Differential Open Question Transition Block (plain text, without any response options for the participant) Depending on the question type, the following attributes can be configured: Name Question name - only used for internal organisation. Blueprint (optional) If associated to a blueprint, the data extracted by this blueprint for a given participant is available to be included in the question text (see below for more information on how to include data in question texts). If the associated blueprint did not extract any data, the question will not be displayed. If a question should always be displayed, select the option \"General Question\" here. Page Number of the page on which the question should be displayed. Index Order in which questions on the same page should be displayed. Variable Name The variable name associated to this question. Will be included in the data export. For items belonging to a question, the variable name will be constructed as follows: \"question_variable_name-{item-value}\". Text The question text that is displayed to participants. Required If a question is marked as required, the application will show a hint to the participant if they forgot to answer this question. This hint will only be shown once. This means that if a participant chooses to ignore the hint and clicks on 'continue', they are able to skip a required question. Randomize items Enable or disable randomization of all items. Here, the items belonging to this question are listed. Click on edit to add and configure the following attributes of question items. Label The label/text of the item that is displayed to participants related to an item. For semantic differential questions, this is the label displayed on the left-hand side of the scale. Label alt Only for semantic differential questions: the label displayed on the right-hand side of the scale. Index Defines the order in which the items are displayed. Value Is (a) the identifier of an item and (b) used to indicate which item(s) has or have been selected in the data export (only for Single and Multi Choice Questions). Randomize Instead of randomizing the order of all items with the randomize setting on the question level, this setting allows randomizing only certain items while those for which this option is not ticked stay in their place (i.e., according to their index). Delete Tick this box if the item should be deleted. The item will be deleted as soon as you click on Update Items. Configure the scale displayed to participants on which they will rate the items related to this question (only for Matrix Question and Semantic Differential). Click on edit to add and configure the following attributes of a scale. Index Defines the order in which the items are displayed. Label The label/text that is displayed to participants associated to the scale point. Value Used to indicate which scale point has been selected in the data export. Add border Setting currently has no effect - still to be implemented. Delete Tick this box if the scale point should be deleted. The scale point will be deleted as soon as you click on Update Scale Points. Depending on the question configuration it is possible to dynamically include both participant-related and donation-related data points in a question text. For this, DDM uses the Django template engine to render question text dynamically for each participant. This means that researchers can include Django’s built-in template tags and filters in the question text to customize question texts as well as access data accessible through predefined variables. This also works for the briefing and debriefing pages. DDM provides two custom variables to be used: A variable called participant that contains information about the current participant (available in all questions). A variable called data that contains the data donated by the current participant (only available for questions that are related to a file blueprint). The participant related data contains the following information: { \"public_id\": \"S0meLonGCh4rSeQuence\", \"data\": { \"url_param\": { \"parameter_a\": \"value a\", \"parameter_b\": \"value b\" }, \"briefing_consent\": \"1\" # or \"0\" if participant did not consent to take part in the study }, \"donation_info\": { \"n_success\": 1, # number of successful donations by this participant \"n_pending\": 1, # number of pending (i.e., not attempted) donations by this participant \"n_failed\": 0, # number of attempted but failed donations by this participant \"n_no_data_extracted\": 0 # number of donations by this participant where all entries were filtered out } } This information can be embedded in any question (i.e., general or blueprint related), any item label, in donation instructions, as well as in the briefing and debriefing text as follows: Dear participant I would like to tell you something about yourself. {% if participant.data.briefing_consent == \"1\" %} You did consent to take part in this study and for this we are really grateful. {% else %} Unfortunately, you did not consent to take part in the study but we respect your decision and completely understand! :') {% endif %} Your public ID is as follows: \"{{ participant.public_id }}\". Please take a photo of this ID. If you wnat to request the deletion of your data at some point in the future you can send an e-mail with your personal public ID to someone@mail.com and your data will be deleted from our servers. A participant that consented to take part in the study will see this question as follows: Dear participant I would like to tell you something about yourself. You did consent to take part in this study and for this we are really grateful. Your public ID is as follows: \"xHQVbrYUYXn5lklW3RGSeouX\". Please take a photo of this ID. If you wnat to request the deletion of your data at some point in the future you can send an e-mail with your personal public ID to someone@mail.com and your data will be deleted from our servers. If a question is related to a file blueprint, the data that was extracted from a participant’s data donation through this file blueprint is available as a template variable called data. As in the case of the participant-related data, the donation-related data can be included in a question text definition following the same logic: This is the title of the last video you watched on YouTube: \"{{ data.0.title }}\" Please indicate below, why you watched this video. This will be rendered as follows: This is the title of the last video you watched on YouTube: \"Data Brokers: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO)\" Please indicate below, why you watched this video. The example above assumes that the donated data is structured as follows: [{'title': 'Data Brokers: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO)', 'timestamp': '2022-12-19T08:49:18'}, {'title': 'Title of second video', 'timestamp': '2022-12-16T11:43:02'}, …​]. If you are starting to construct a dynamic question text, first include the complete data objects stored in the variables in your question text (e.g., {{ participant }}, {{ data }}). Next, open the link to your study in an anonymous browser window and go through the steps until you reach the questionnaire part. This way you can see how the data object is structured and figure out from there, how you can access the information on deeper levels of the data structure. You can then start to adjust the variables and reload the anonymous window every time you made a change to the question definition to see how your new specification will be rendered. Debriefing text Text displayed to participants on the debriefing page. Sometimes you might want to display different debriefing texts depending on the previous actions of your participant (e.g., if a participant did indicate that they do not want to take part in the study, or if a participant did not attempt to donate any data). For this, you can make use of the templating engine and, for example, define the following debriefing page that displays a different text to a participant that did not attempt to donate any that compared to a participant who donated at least some data (the example assumes that two donations were expected in this study): {% if participant.donation_info.n_success > 0 %} Dear participant, Thank you very much for participating in our study. With your data donation, you made a great contribution towards advancing our understanding of algorithmic selection on the internet. {% endif %} {% if participant.donation_info.n_pending == 2 %} Dear participant, Thank you for your time. Because you did not attempt to donate any data, you are unfortunately not eligible to receive the participation reward. {% endif %} You can read more about how to use dynamic templates here. In the Data Center, you can find options to (a) access the collected data, (b) access the project logs, and (c) find some general field statistics about the progress of your project. There are two options to download your data: Internal Download: When you are logged in, click on Download Data as JSON. This will gather your data from the database, and you will be able to download the json file in your browser. External Download via API (advanced option): There is also the possibility to download your data through an API endpoint remotely. For this, an API token has to be created which will need to be supplied when sending the request to the API (see below for an example). Through the admin interface, a project can only be accessed by the user who created it. This means that the internal download is only accessible for a project owner. The API token, on the other hand, can be used to share data access with colleagues working on the same project. However, be careful with whom you share this token as it exposes the sensitive data collected from participants. We recommend choosing a short expiration date for Tokens that you create. When downloading your data, you will receive a .json file with the following structure: { \"project\": { \"pk\": 1, \"name\": \"project name\", \"date_created\": \"2022-12-19T08:49:18.363880+01:00\" }, \"donations\": { \"blueprint name 1\": [ { \"participant\": 1 \"project\": 1, \"time_submitted\": \"2022-12-19T08:49:18.363880+01:00\", \"consent\": true, \"status\": \"success\", # One of \"success\" (donation successful); \"pending\" (donation not attempted); \"failed\" (donation failed due to an error); \"nothing extracted\" (all data filtered out) \"data\": [ { \"extracted_field_1\": \"value1_entry1\", \"extracted_field_2\": \"value2_entry1\", # ... }, { \"extracted_field_1\": \"value1_entry2\", \"extracted_field_2\": \"value2_entry2\", # ... }, # etc. ] } ], \"blueprint name 2\": [ { \"participant\": 1, \"project\": 1, \"time_submitted\": \"...\", # etc. } ] }, \"questionnaire\": [ { \"participant\": 1, \"project\": 1, \"time_submitted\": \"2023-01-19T08:49:18.363880+01:00\", \"responses\": { \"variable_name\": \"answer to question\", \"variable_name-item-value\": \"answer to item\" }, \"meta_data\": { # For data validation purposes: contains one entry per question consisting of meta information about how the question was presented to the participant: \"question-id\": { \"response\": \"1\", # Can be a dict of form {\"item-id\": \"item-response\", ...} for question types with item responses \"question\": \"question text in html format as displayed to participant\", \"items\": [ { \"id\": \"33\", \"label\": \"label text in html format as displayed to participant\", \"label_alt\": \"alternative label text in html format as displayed to participant\", # only applies to semantic differential \"index\": \"1\", \"value\": \"1\", \"randomize\": false } ] } } } ], \"participants\": [ { \"pk\": 1, \"project\": 1, \"external_id\": \"DMXdpfVyksagfqql2cTgp8kF\", \"start_time\": \"2023-01-18T08:49:18.363880+01:00\", \"end_time\": \"2023-01-20T08:49:18.363880+01:00\", \"completed\": true, \"extra_data\": { \"url_param\": { \"some_url_parameter\": \"some value extracted from this parameter when the briefing page was called.\", # ... } } } ] } The Project Log should help researchers to monitor their ongoing data collection and to identify potential problems occurring during the data donation. Two types of logs exist for each project: An Exception Log and an Event Log. The Exception Log lists all exceptions that participants encountered during the study. The log provides the following information: The date and time when the exception occurred The type of the exception (for a description of the type-codes, see here) Which participant encountered the exception (if applicable) For which file blueprint the exception occurred (if applicable) If the exception was raised on the client-side (i.e., the participant’s browser) or the server side A message describing the exception The Event Log currently registers the following events: When an access token is created or deleted When the API endpoint for the project was called but authentication failed or permission was denied When a data download attempt was successful, failed or denied. When a data delete attempt was successful, failed, or denied. When a participant delete request was successful, failed, or denied. The Participation Statistics currently display the following information: Donated Files: The number of successfully donated files. Started: The number of participants that started the study. Completed: The number of participants that reached the debriefing page of the study. Completion Rate: The number of started divided by the number of completed participations. Avrg. to complete: The average time it took a participant from starting the study to reaching the debriefing page. Here, you can find all options that affect the data collected in the course of your project: With this option, you can delete all data collected for a given project. You can delete the data for a given participant by providing their external participation id. You can show your participants their external participation id (also referred to as public_id) during the study (e.g., embedded in a transition block as part of the questionnaire) and inform them that by providing their public ID they can request the deletion of their data in the future if they change their mind. This function can then help you to delete a participant from the database (if your study is still ongoing at the time a participant requests the deletion of their data). See here for an example of how this could be done. With this option you can delete the current project. This will also delete all associated data.","title":"Documentation for Researchers","component":"ddm","version":"v1.0.0","name":"for_researchers","url":"/ddm/v1.0.0/for_researchers.html","titles":[{"text":"Setting Up a Data Donation Project","hash":"_setting_up_a_data_donation_project","id":1},{"text":"Creating a Project","hash":"_creating_a_project","id":2},{"text":"The Project Hub","hash":"_the_project_hub","id":3},{"text":"Editing Project Details","hash":"_editing_project_details","id":4},{"text":"Base Settings","hash":"_base_settings","id":5},{"text":"Public Project Information","hash":"_public_project_information","id":6},{"text":"URL Parameter Extraction","hash":"_url_parameter_extraction","id":7},{"text":"Redirect Configuration","hash":"_redirect_configuration","id":8},{"text":"Project Appearance","hash":"_project_appearance","id":9},{"text":"Editing Project Configuration","hash":"_editing_project_configuration","id":10},{"text":"Briefing","hash":"_briefing","id":11},{"text":"Data Donation","hash":"_data_donation","id":12},{"text":"Configure File Uploader","hash":"_configure_file_uploader","id":13},{"text":"Configure Instructions","hash":"_configure_instructions","id":14},{"text":"Configure Donation Blueprint","hash":"_configure_donation_blueprint","id":15},{"text":"JSON specific settings","hash":"_json_specific_settings","id":16},{"text":"CSV specific settings","hash":"_csv_specific_settings","id":17},{"text":"Extraction Rules","hash":"_extraction_rules","id":18},{"text":"Questionnaire","hash":"_questionnaire","id":19},{"text":"How the Questionnaire Works","hash":"_how_the_questionnaire_works","id":20},{"text":"Question Configuration Settings","hash":"_question_configuration_settings","id":21},{"text":"Question Items","hash":"_question_items","id":22},{"text":"Scale Configuration","hash":"_scale_configuration","id":23},{"text":"Including Data Dynamically in a Question","hash":"_including_data_dynamically_in_a_question","id":24},{"text":"Participant-Related Data","hash":"_participant_related_data","id":25},{"text":"Donation-Related Data","hash":"_donation_related_data","id":26},{"text":"Debriefing","hash":"_debriefing","id":27},{"text":"Data Center","hash":"_data_center","id":28},{"text":"Data Download: Accessing Collected Data Donations","hash":"_data_download_accessing_collected_data_donations","id":29},{"text":"Data Structure","hash":"_data_structure","id":30},{"text":"Project Log: Monitoring an on-going Project","hash":"_project_log_monitoring_an_on_going_project","id":31},{"text":"Exception Log","hash":"_exception_log","id":32},{"text":"Event Log","hash":"_event_log","id":33},{"text":"Participation Statistics","hash":"_participation_statistics","id":34},{"text":"Danger Zone","hash":"_danger_zone","id":35},{"text":"Reset Project Data","hash":"_reset_project_data","id":36},{"text":"Delete Participant","hash":"_delete_participant","id":37},{"text":"Delete Project","hash":"_delete_project","id":38}]},"5":{"id":5,"text":"DDM DDM Documentation DDM (Data Donation Module) is an open-source Django/web application that helps researchers to set up data donation projects and to collect data donations for academic research. The application is intended to be hosted at an institutional level (e.g., a university, a university division, or a research conglomerate) as it provides the possibility to host multiple independent data donation projects simultaneously. Nevertheless, it is also possible to use it for single projects. It is developed by the Media Use and Effects Division at the University of Zurich. The Data Donation Module is embedded in the Data Donation Lab, a larger initiative of the University of Zurich and the Digital Society Initiative to strengthen the exchange about the topic of data donations and promote this data collection approach. For more information, visit https://datadonation.uzh.ch. This project is currently under active development. The Data Donation Module enables researchers to setup a data donation project that, from the participants' perspective, consists of the following steps: 1) Briefing Page At the beginning, participants are presented with a briefing page. On this page, researchers can describe their project, brief participants about the upcoming steps, and optionally obtain explicit consent for participation. 2) Data Donation Next, participants are presented with a user interface through which they can donate their data. This interface consists of (1) a set of instructions, (2) a data upload form, and (3) a feedback area. The participation flow in this step looks as follows: The participant reads the instructions and downloads/finds the relevant file on their PC. The participant uploads their data with the provided upload form. The uploaded data is filtered and transformed according to the rules defined by the researcher (e.g., only certain fields are extracted). The participant is presented with the filtered/transformed data which they will be donating to the researchers. Based on d, the participant can decide whether to donate their data (i.e., submit their data to the reseacher’s server). Steps b to d are all client-based and executed in the participant’s browser. No personal data is submitted until step e. 3) Follow-Up Questionnaire (optional) After the data donation, participants can optionally be presented with a questionnaire. Questions defined in this questionnaire can be configured to include data points from the donated data – either to enrich the donated data or to provide participants with insights into their personal data. 4) End/Debriefing Page Lastly, participants are presented with a debriefing page. From here, participants can optionally be redirected to another website or web application. Different parts of the documentation are targeted at different user groups of the application. Documentation for Researchers: This section is for researchers who use DDM to set up their data donation projects on an existing application server. Documentation for Administrator: This section is for server administrators who want to set up a server to host DDM. Documentation for Developers: This section is for developers who want to contribute to the development of DDM or want to fork and extend DDM on their own. Furthermore, the section Topic References contains more detailed information on various specialized topics.","title":"DDM Documentation","component":"ddm","version":"v1.0.0","name":"index","url":"/ddm/v1.0.0/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview of DDM","hash":"_overview_of_ddm","id":1},{"text":"Core Functionality","hash":"_core_functionality","id":2},{"text":"Documentation Structure","hash":"_documentation_structure","id":3}]},"6":{"id":6,"text":"DDM Reporting Issues and Getting Help If you encounter issues or detect a bug, please open a new issue in the GitHub repository.

The default admin templates include a minimalistic header and footer that do not integrate any actions related to a researchers user account because authentication is handled by the main website (see User Authentication). However, for your own project you may wish to replace the default header and/or footer within the admin interface to include your own branding and provide your users with some account management options such as a logout button. This can be done by using Django’s template inheritance. In your application create a new html template your_application/templates/ddm/admin/base.html. In this file, you can overwrite the header and/or footer as follows: {% extends \"ddm/admin/base.html\" %} {% block extrahead %} <!-- If you wish, you can integrate custom css files, favicon etc. here --> {% endblock %} {% block header %} <div> <!-- Your Custom Header HTML --> </div> {% endblock %} {% block footer %} <div> <!-- Your Custom Footer HTML --> </div> {% endblock %} This pages aims to describe what types of encryption should be used by the system hosting this module and what is implemented in this module. It is site-level responsibility to setup encryption in transit, like SSL/TLS for all communication between clients and the server. For some hints on how this should be setup, start with the Django docs. We minimize the amount of potential data that is processed on the server, by doing most of the filtering client-side. Do take into account that ideally the connection from system to the database is secured as well, and that the database is stored on an encrypted system. The module stores all data in encrypted fields in the database, the encryption/decryption procedure is described below. Each project has a unique salt that is generated when creating the project. In the Django site settings, we use the SECRET_KEY as the default passphrase for encryption. If a project is working with sensitive data, we recommend that a project specific password is set. This password is only known by the person setting it and should not be shared. A project specific password will limit the functionality of the module for a given project: it won’t be possible to create followup questions based on the data donation. We use a hybrid asymmetric/symmetric encryption approach, due to the size limitation of the pure asymmetric approach. The following steps occur in the encryption process - generate a public key and store it in the project (if none exists) - generate a session key used for encrypting a single message - encrypt the data symmetrically using the session key - encrypt the session key using the public key asymmetrically - store the encrypted data with the encrypted key as header The following steps occur in the decryption process - generate a private key - get the desired encrypted data from the project - decrypt the encrypted session key (header) asymmetrically using the private key - decrypt the data using the decrypted session key symmetrically For encryption we only need the public key; - Check if we have a public key that is saved for the project - if not, we should have gotten a passphrase and a salt with which we can generate a public key. — generate the private key — derive the public key — save the public key for the project - We then use PKCS#1 OAEP for the wrapping and OAEP padding. For decryption we need the private key; - Using the supplied passphrase and salt, we generate a 128bit HMAC digest, which we use to populate a pseudo-random number generator. - This random number generator is used to generate our RSA key. - We then use PKCS#1 OAEP for wrapping the OAEP padding. There are significant limitations on the size of the data that can be encrypted using asymmetric algorithms and severe performance penalties. This is why we combine this with symmetric encryption. In our case we use AES to encrypt the actual data. The Data Donation Module uses the default Django user management to authenticate users. For production use in the context of an academic institution we recommend implementing authentication through an academic authentication infrastructure with OpenID Connect (OIDC) - see below. In the case of single user instances, i.e., if DDM is installed and deployed to only support one specific project, this step is not necessary. TODO: Explain creation of researcher profiles: 1. Login/Register through default authentication → 2. Create a DDM research profile associated to authenticated account → 3. redirect to ddm projects For authentication to work properly make sure you do the following in your main site: Define a login and logout view in urls.py: from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views urlpatterns = [ # ... path('login/', auth_views.LoginView.as_view(template_name='myapp/login.html'), name='ddm-login'), path('logout/', auth_views.LogoutView.as_view(), name='ddm-logout'), ] Either, you define your own template ('myapp/login.html'), or you can reuse or customize the default DDM login template ('ddm/admin/auth/login.html' or 'ddm/admin/auth/login_oidc.html' if you use OIDC authentication). Define Proper redirect paths in your settings.py: # Paths to redirect after login/logout LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/auth/researcher/' LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = '/login/' We recommend using the package mozilla-django-oidc for OIDC authentication. To enable OIDC authentication with mozilla-django-oidc, follow these steps (see also the official mozilla-django-oidc documentation): Setup a client with an OpenID provider. Install mozilla-django-oidc: pip install mozilla-django-oidc Next, adjust your settings.py. Add 'mozilla_django_oidc' to INSTALLED_APPS after 'django.contrib.auth':: INSTALLED_APPS = ( # ...

Exception Message: TODO To be implemented The administration interface for researchers currently only supports English. The participation interface currently supports English and German. The language in which the interface for participants is displayed is determined by the default language of the participant’s browser. If a language is not implemented for the participant interface, it is displayed in English. To add support for a new language, new locales must be added at two locations: Translations for the Django part of DDM are located at /ddm/locale/. An extensive description of how translation is handled by Django can be found here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/i18n/translation/ To create the translation files, first run django-admin makemessages -l de in the ddm directory, where de is the locale name that you want to create. This command creates or updates a file located at ddm/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/django.po. In this file, you can add your translations. Afterwards, run django-admin compilemessages to create a django.mo file, which will be used by gettext for translation. The translation files for the vue components are located at /frontend/src/translations/. Here, support for a new language can be added by appending the respective locale name as a first-level key to the json files and adding corresponding translations for all translation blocks. Oftentimes, it can take some time between requesting a data takeout from a platform and actually being able to download this takeout. Therefore, researchers might want to provide their study participants with the possibility to pause their participation and continue with the study as soon as they were able to download their personal data takeout.

If you are planning to install DDM for production use, we advise to follow a comprehensive tutorial such as the one provided by Digital Ocean. To install Django and DDM, we strongly advise to use a new virtual environment (venv) for the installation. To create a new venv, run the following command in the folder where you want your installation to be located (the commands listed here should work for Linux and macOS; for other setups see here). ProjectPath> python -m venv /path/to/venv Then you can activate the environment as follows: ProjectPath> source /path/to/venv/bin/activate (venv) ProjectPath> Next, install Django in your virtual environment: (venv) ProjectPath> pip install Django==3.2.* Now that Django is installed, start a new project and access it: (venv) ProjectPath> django-admin startproject yourproject (venv) ProjectPath> cd yourproject This will create a new folder yourproject that contains a file called manage.py and a folder that is also called yourproject. In this subfolder you will find, among others, the settings.py and the urls.py file. Next, create a superuser account with your Django project: (venv) ProjectPath/yourproject> python manage.py createsuperuser You will be asked to provide a username and a password. To see whether the installation of Django worked run the following command and see whether the base site loads: (venv) ProjectPath/yourproject> python manage.py runserver Install the Django DDM package: (venv) ProjectPath/yourproject> pip install django-ddm Next, you will have to adjust several sections of your settings.py and urls.py files.

'ddm.context_processors.add_ddm_version' # Add this. ], }, }, ] Configure CKEditor settings in your settings.py to allow your users to upload images and gifs in instructions and question texts: # settings.py CKEDITOR_RESTRICT_BY_USER = True # Files uploaded by one user can only be accessed by this particular user CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_PATH = 'uploads/' Add time zone support to your settings.py: # settings.py USE_TZ = True Optionally, an e-mail address restriction can be defined in settings.py. Only users whose e-mail address matches the defined regex pattern will be allowed to set up data donation projects: # settings.py DDM_SETTINGS = { 'EMAIL_PERMISSION_CHECK': r'.*(\\.|@)somedomain\\.com$', }, Include the DDM urls in your projects urls.py: # urls.py urlpatterns = [ # ... path('ddm/', include('ddm.urls')), ] Configure login and logout endpoints for DDM in urls.py: # urls.py urlpatterns = [ ... path('ddm/', include('ddm.urls')), path('login/', auth_views.LoginView.as_view(template_name='ddm/admin/auth/login.html'), name='ddm-login'), # You can choose whatever path and template you like path('logout/', auth_views.LogoutView.as_view(), name='ddm-logout'), # You can choose whatever path and template you like ] If you use DDM on a Django site together with wagtail and you have internationalization enabled for your wagtail urls, we recommend to use the prefix_default_language=False for the i18n_patterns: # urls.py urlpatterns += i18n_patterns( path('', include(wagtail_urls)), prefix_default_language=False ) Not doing this will cause ddm.tests.test_apis.test_participant_deletion_with_regular_login to fail. In practice, the participant API still seems to work properly despite the test failing, however, unexpected behaviour cannot be ruled out at this point. This will be fixed in a future version. Furthermore, add the following to your urls.py: # urls.py urlpatterns = [ ... path('ckeditor/', include('ckeditor_uploader.urls')), ] DDM uses a custom CKEditor toolbar for instruction and question text definitions that can optionally be customized (find out more) The Python installation includes SQLite which is configured to be used as a database backend in the standard settings.py created by Django. For a development environment, this SQLite is totally fine, however for a production deployment you should consider configuring a more robust and efficient database such as PostgreSQL or MariaDB (see the Django Documentation for further information). Once you have configured a database, run python manage.py migrate to create the ddm models in your database. To test if your installation was successful, run python manage.py test ddm. Next, run python manage.py runserver to start the server locally. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin to ensure that the Data Donation Module is listed as a subsection in the administration interface. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ddm/projects to see whether you can access the ddm project overview site and try to create a new project. You can provide default images to be included in the header of the participation views. These images will be displayed by default, but can be overwritten on a project-basis by researchers in the project settings. To enable default images, provide the paths to the images that you want to display in the left and/or right part of the public header in your settings.py as follows: # settings.py DDM_DEFAULT_HEADER_IMG_LEFT = '/path/to/logo_left.png' DDM_DEFAULT_HEADER_IMG_RIGHT = '/path/to/logo_right.png' Official Django Documentation Official Python Documentation Django Tutorials on W3Schools or Digital Ocean Information for developers in this documentation","title":"Documentation for System Administrators","component":"ddm","version":"v1.0.19","name":"for_admins","url":"/ddm/v1.0.19/for_admins.html","titles":[{"text":"Getting Started","hash":"_getting_started","id":1},{"text":"Install Django","hash":"_install_django","id":2},{"text":"Install DDM","hash":"_install_ddm","id":3},{"text":"Update Settings.py","hash":"_update_settings_py","id":4},{"text":"Update urls.py","hash":"_update_urls_py","id":5},{"text":"Apply Database Migrations","hash":"_apply_database_migrations","id":6},{"text":"Test Installation","hash":"_test_installation","id":7},{"text":"Optional Settings","hash":"_optional_settings","id":8},{"text":"Default Header Images","hash":"_default_header_images","id":9},{"text":"Further Resources","hash":"_further_resources","id":10}]},"19":{"id":19,"text":"DDM For Developers The repository includes a django test project that can be used for local development and testing. Once you have cloned or forked the GitHub repository, activate your local virtual environment and install the following requirements: (venv) SomePath/ddm> pip install -r requirements.txt A basic standard configuration for the test project is specified in test_project/test_config.json. Adjust the information in this file if you want to use a custom setup, or use another database. By default, the test project uses SQLite as a database backend. If you do make changes to this file, please do NOT commit these changes to the shared repository. Through the setup described above, the regular django commands are now available: To start the development server use the following commands: (venv) SomePath/ddm/test_project> python manage.py runserver To create new migrations based on the changes made to the models, run: (venv) SomePath/ddm/test_project> python manage.py makemigrations To apply existing migrations to your local database, run: [1] (venv) SomePath/ddm/test_project> python manage.py migrate To run unit tests, use: (venv) SomePath/ddm/test_project> python manage.py test ddm To run the app in development mode, you will need to serve both Django’s dev server and the webpack development server. From the frontend directory, run: (venv) SomePath/ddm/frontend> npm run serve And, in a separate terminal in the Django root directory, run the Django development server: (venv) SomePath/ddm/test_project> python manage.py runserver Open your locally hosted Django app in a browser (e.g. http://localhost:8000). When it is time to deploy, or when you simply want to omit running the Vue dev server, you can build the Vue project in production mode. Cancel the npm run serve process if it is running and instead run npm run build. The optimized bundles will be built in and placed into the Django static file location, and webpack-stats.json will be updated to reflect this new configuration. The vue builds should end up in the static folder of the django module (ddm/static). This project uses GitHub actions for automated testing and CI tasks. A push to develop triggers build tests for the following configurations: Python: [3.8, 3.10.4] Database: [sqlite, mysql] A tag (vX.X.X) push to develop triggers build tests (see above). If the tests are successful develop is automatically merged into main. Please make sure that pushed tags are in sync with package versions on PyPi. If the build-tests of a pushed tag fail, delete the tag[2] and push the fixed version again with the same tag until the tests run through. A push to main triggers build tests and if the tests are successful, automatically bumps the version number (patch number) and builds a new PyPi package. The tests have the same configurations as on develop. A pull request to main created by dependabot will automatically update the affected dependencies and merge into main. A regular push to develop triggers the following pipeline: Run tests on develop. Create new documentation for GitHub pages. A tag (\"vX.X.X\") push to develop triggers the following pipeline: Run tests on develop. Create new documentation for GitHub pages. Merge develop into main. Run tests on main. Create PyPi package. A pull request to main created by dependabot triggers the following pipeline: Update dependencies. Merge into main. Run tests on main. Create PyPi package. A new release is created manually and includes: Bumping the minor or major part of the version. Updating setup.cfg. Ideally, add a changelog. This documentation is written in AsciiDoc and compiled using Antora. The documentation UI uses the Antora DDM UI which is based on the default Antora UI.

How to monitor an ongoing data donation project. How to download and work with the collected data. It is assumed that a server with DDM set up on it is running. Readers interested in setting up a server to run DDM for institutional use or their own research should turn to the Documentation for Administrators. For a general introduction to the module, see this page. To set up a new data donation project, got to the /projects/ page and click on \"+ Create New Project\". On the project creation page, you will be presented with the following options to configure your project: Project Name Name of the project. Visible to participants in the browser’s title bar or a page’s tab. URL Identifier Identifier that is included in the URL through which participants can access the project (e.g, https://root.url/project-slug). Contact Information Contact information of the researcher responsible for the project. Is linked in the footer of the donation interface and can be viewed by data donors at any stage of the data donation process. Data Protection Statement Data protection statement that describes how the data is processed. Is linked in the footer of the donation interface and can be viewed by data donors at any stage of the data donation process. Super Secret When creating a \"super secret\" project, you will have to provide a project password, which will be used to encrypt all collected data donations and survey responses (for more information on how collected data is encrypted, see here). This password will not be saved by the application, and the data collected for this project can only be encrypted by entering the password that was used as a super secret when the project was created. Please note that there is no way to recover or reset this password if it is lost. Furthermore, also note that making a project \"super secret\" will limit the functionality of the module: it won’t be possible to create followup questions based on the data donation (i.e., data points from the data donation cannot be referenced in a question). Once a project is created, you will be redirected to the \"Project Hub\". From here, you can access all settings and information that are relevant for your data donation project. It consists of four main areas: Project Details Project Configuration Data Center Danger Zone Project Name Name of the project. Visible to participants in the browser’s title bar or a page’s tab. External Project Slug Identifier that is used to expose the project to participants (e.g, https://root.url/project-slug ). Contact Information Contact information of the researcher responsible for the project. Is linked in the footer of the donation interface and can be viewed by data donors at any stage of the data donation process. Data Protection Statement Data protection statement that describes how the data is processed. Is linked in the footer of the donation interface and can be viewed by data donors at any stage of the data donation process. Optionally, information can be extracted from parameters passed with the URL when a project is accessed by a participant. This can be configured using the following settings: URL parameter extraction enabled Enable or disable whether URL parameters should be extracted when participants access the project’s briefing page. Expected URL parameter Provide a string containing the parameters that should be extracted. Separate multiple parameters with a semikolon (e.g., \"parameter_A;parameter_B\"). The extracted values will be saved for each participant and is included in the data export. If a parameter is not present, it will be saved as None. Undefined parameters passed in the URL will be ignored. If participants are asked to first fill out a questionnaire created in an external survey software such as e.g. Unipark or Qualtrics, passing URL parameters can be used to link data donations with the survey data by passing a participant ID in the URL parameters. Optionally, participants can be redirected to another website from the debriefing page. This can be configured using the following settings: Redirect enabled Enable or disable the redirection of your participants when they have completed your project. If enabled, a redirect button will be displayed on the data donation end page that redirects to the URL defined in the Redirect target setting. Redirect target URL to which participants will redirected (only required if redirect is enabled). The redirect URL can include information on the participant and the project ID. For this, you can use variables that are populated with the respective values. Currently, the following variables are supported: The participant data is accessible with {{ participant }} and the project ID can be inserted with {{ project_id }}. E.g., https://redirect.url?param={{participant.data.url_param.URLParameter}}&participant={{participant.public_id}}&project={{project_id}} See this section for more information on the {{ participant }}-variable. The following settings are available to customize the appearance of your data donation project: Header Image Left/Header Image Right Upload an image that will be displayed in the header of your project (e.g., an institution or project logo). The structure of the Project Configuration follows the steps of the prototypical data donation process. It consists of the following sections: Welcome Page: Define what is displayed to participants when they enter your project. Data Donation: Define the expected data donations, extraction rules, and donation instructions. Questionnaire: Define questions that will be shown to participants after they have donated their data. End Page: Define what is displayed when participants reach the end of the data donation. Briefing Text Text displayed to participants on the briefing page. in the briefing text, you can make use of dynamic template functionalities. You can read more about how to use dynamic templates here. Briefing Consent Mandatory If briefing consent is enabled, participants will have to explicitly indicate their consent at the bottom of the briefing page before they can continue. If a participant does indicate that they to do not consent, they will be redirected to the debriefing page. Briefing consent label yes/Briefing consent label no The labels displayed to participants to indicate consent (\"briefing consent label yes\") or reject consent (\"briefing consent label no\"). The data donation is organized in File Uploaders and Donation Blueprints. A \"File Uploader\" corresponds to the file that is expected to be uploaded. This file can either be a single file (e.g., a JSON file) or a ZIP container. For each File Uploader, a set of Instructions for participants can be defined that describe how they can access and upload the requested file. Each uploader has one or multiple associated Donation Blueprints (although if a File Uploader expects a single file, only one Donation Blueprint can be associated with it). A Donation Blueprint defines how the data contained in a single file (e.g., the uploaded file in the case of a single file upload, or a file contained in the ZIP container in the case of a ZIP upload) is extracted. The data donation step can incorporate multiple File Uploaders. Name Name of the File Uploader. Will be publicly visible to participants in the header of the File Uplaoder. Upload Type Either \"single file\" or \"zip file\". Index The position of the file uploader on the data donation page. Only relevant if multiple File Uploaders are displayed – File Uploaders with a lower index will be displayed closer to the top of the page. All-in-one consent If enabled, participants will be asked to consent to submit all uploaded data at once. Otherwise, participant will be asked to consent to the submission of the data separately for each blueprint. Associated Donation Blueprints The donation blueprints that apply to the expected file(s) collected with the File Uploader. Donation Instructions consist of one or multiple instruction pages. Instruction pages are displayed as a slide show at the top of File Uploader. For each instruction page, the following can be configured: Text The instruction text displayed to the participants. By default, researchers can also upload and include images or gifs to guide participants through the data donation process in this field (currently, video upload is not supported). The participant’s external ID is available as a template variable to be included in the instruction text as follows: {{ participant_id }} which will be displayed to the participant as something like IPI2wHDWrHODDRKuo8zo101S. This is helpful to enable participants to continue the data donation at a later point in time (e.g., because it can take some time between requesting data takeout and being able to download it); read this section of the documentation to find out how this can be done. Index The position of the page in the slideshow. NOTE If no instructions are defined for a File Uploader, the instruction section will be hidden in the participation view. Name Name of the expected data donations. Will be publicly visible to participants. Therefore, it is important to define a meaningful name. Description Description of what the blueprint will extract. If defined, the description will be visible for participants in the data donation step. Associated File Uploader The File Uploader for which the blueprint will be applied. File path Here, the path where the file is expected to be located within a ZIP file is defined. Only necessary, if the Donation Blueprint is part of a Blueprint Container. If a regex expression matches two files, DDM extracts the first one that matches the expression. Afterwards, it does not look any further, even if the matched file does not match the expected fields. Therefore, be careful to choose regex expressions that will only match the expected file. Examples for regex paths to match files Regex Description ^MyActivities.json Matches a file named MyActivities.json that is located at the root of the ZIP file. ^SpecificFolder/MyActivities\\.json Matches a file named MyActivities.json that is located in a folder named SpecificFolder in the root of the ZIP file. .*MyActivities\\.json Matches file if the filename ends with MyActivities.json that can be located anywhere in the ZIP file. Warning: This also matches e.g. BogusMyAcitivties.json. (^MyActivities\\.json|^MeineAktivitäten\\.json|^MieAttivita\\.json) Matches a file that is located at the root of the ZIP file and either named MyActivities.json, MeineAktivitäten.json, or MieAttivita.json. Can be helpful to match the same file in different languages. You can find about more about regex here. On this website, you will also find some Tools that can help you test regex patterns. Expected fields The fields that must be contained in the donated file. If a file does not contain all fields defined here, it will not be accepted as a donation. Put the field names in double quotes (\") and separate them with commas (\"Field A\", \"Field B\"). You can also use regular expressions (regex) to match expected fields - for this, you must enable the expected field regex matching option (see below). Expected field regex matching Select if you use a regex expression in the Expected fields setting. Expected File Format The file format of the expected data donation. Currently, only JSON and CSV is implemented. Extraction Root Indicates on which level of the files' data structure information should be extracted. If you want to extract information contained on the first level (e.g., {'field to be extracted': value}, you can leave this field empty. If you want to extract data located on a higher level, then you would provide the path to the parent field of the data you want to extract (e.g., if your json file is structured like this {'friends': {'real_friends': [{'name to extract': name, 'date to extract': date}], 'fake friends': [{'name': name, 'date': date }]}} and you want to extract the names and dates of real_friends, you would set the extraction root to friends.real_friends. CSV Delimiter The delimiter used in the expected file (e.g., , or ;). If left empty, the used Javascript function will try to infer the delimiter from the file structure. The base assumption for the extraction of the data contained in an uploaded file is that you do not want any data. This means that when you configure your extraction rules, you first have to add a rule for each field that you want to keep in your data. Execution Order The order in which the extraction rules are applied to a file. Name The name of an extraction rule. For internal organisation only. Field The field to which the rule will be applied. This can either be a \"normal\" string or a regular expression (regex). If the latter is the case, you must also select regex field (see below). Regex field Select if you use a regex expression in the Field setting of this rule. Extraction Operator Defines the main logic of the extraction step. Overview of available extraction operators Extraction Operator Description Note Keep Field Keep this field in the uploaded data. – Equal (==) Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given field equals the comparison value. Works for strings, integers, and dates1. Not Equal (!=) Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given field does not equal the comparison value. Works for strings, integers, and dates1. Greater than (>) Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given field is greater than the comparison value. Works for integers and dates1. String values are skipped and the row will be kept in the data. Smaller than (<) Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given field is smaller than the comparison value. Works for integers and dates1. String values are skipped and the row will be kept in the data. Greater than or equal (>=) Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given field is greater than or equal to the comparison value. Works for integers and dates1. String values are skipped and the row will be kept in the data. Smaller than or equal (⇐) Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given field is smaller than or equal to the comparison value. Works for integers and dates1. String values are skipped and the row will be kept in the data. Delete match (regex) Delete parts of the value contained in the given field that match the given regular expression (regex) (e.g., if the regular expression (regex) = \"^Watched \" and a field contains the value \"Watched video XY\" the following value will be kept in the uploaded data: \"video XY\"). All field values are converted to strings before this operation is applied. Replace match (regex) Replace parts of the value contained in the given field that match the given regular expression (regex) (e.g., if the regular expression (regex) = \"@([\\w-]\\.)+[\\w-]{2,4}\" and the replacement value = \"anonymized\" and a field contains the value \"some text email@address.com\" the following value will be kept in the uploaded data: \"some text anonymized\"). All field values are converted to strings before this operation is applied. Delete row when match (regex) Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given field matches the given regular expression (regex) (e.g., if regular expression (regex) = \"^Watched \" and a field contains the value \"Watched video XY\" the row/entry will be deleted from the uploaded data). All field values are converted to strings before this operation is applied. 1Dates are inferred from string values if they are formatted according to ISO, RFC2822, or HTTP standards, and only if both the field value and the comparison value follow the same format. Otherwise, the entry will be treated as a regular string. Comparison Value The value against which the data contained in the indicated field will be compared according to the selected comparison logic. Replacement Value Only required for operation \"Replace match (regex)\". The value that will be used as a replacement if the regex pattern matches. Researchers can optionally define a questionnaire that is displayed after the data donation. The questionnaire is displayed after the data donation step and consists of one or more pages, each consisting of one or more questions. A question can either be general or be related to a file blueprint. General questions are displayed to all participants, regardless if they successfully donated any data. Questions related to a file blueprint are only displayed to those participants that successfully uploaded some data to the related file blueprint. This means that if the data extraction for a specific file blueprint either fails, is not attempted or zero data entries are extracted because all entries were filtered out, the question will not be displayed. For questions related to a file blueprint, the data extracted by the related blueprint for a given participant is available to be included in the question text (see below for more information on how to include data in question texts). The questionnaire responses are only submitted to the server after all questions have been answered. This means that if a participants aborts the questionnaire after filling out, e.g., 2 out of 4 questions, no responses will be collected and saved on the server. Currently, the following question types are implemented: Single Choice Question Multi Choice Question Matrix Question Semantic Differential Open Question Transition Block (plain text, without any response options for the participant) Depending on the question type, the following attributes can be configured: Name Question name - only used for internal organisation. Blueprint (optional) If associated to a blueprint, the data extracted by this blueprint for a given participant is available to be included in the question text (see below for more information on how to include data in question texts). If the associated blueprint did not extract any data, the question will not be displayed. If a question should always be displayed, select the option \"General Question\" here. Page Number of the page on which the question should be displayed. Index Order in which questions on the same page should be displayed. Variable Name The variable name associated to this question. Will be included in the data export. For items belonging to a question, the variable name will be constructed as follows: \"question_variable_name-{item-value}\". Text The question text that is displayed to participants. Required If a question is marked as required, the application will show a hint to the participant if they forgot to answer this question. This hint will only be shown once. This means that if a participant chooses to ignore the hint and clicks on 'continue', they are able to skip a required question. Randomize items Enable or disable randomization of all items. Here, the items belonging to this question are listed. Click on edit to add and configure the following attributes of question items. Label The label/text of the item that is displayed to participants related to an item. For semantic differential questions, this is the label displayed on the left-hand side of the scale. Label alt Only for semantic differential questions: the label displayed on the right-hand side of the scale. Index Defines the order in which the items are displayed. Value Is (a) the identifier of an item and (b) used to indicate which item(s) has or have been selected in the data export (only for Single and Multi Choice Questions). Randomize Instead of randomizing the order of all items with the randomize setting on the question level, this setting allows randomizing only certain items while those for which this option is not ticked stay in their place (i.e., according to their index). Delete Tick this box if the item should be deleted. The item will be deleted as soon as you click on Update Items. Configure the scale displayed to participants on which they will rate the items related to this question (only for Matrix Question and Semantic Differential). Click on edit to add and configure the following attributes of a scale. Index Defines the order in which the items are displayed. Label The label/text that is displayed to participants associated to the scale point. Value Used to indicate which scale point has been selected in the data export. Add border Setting currently has no effect - still to be implemented. Delete Tick this box if the scale point should be deleted. The scale point will be deleted as soon as you click on Update Scale Points. Depending on the question configuration it is possible to dynamically include both participant-related and donation-related data points in a question text. For this, DDM uses the Django template engine to render question text dynamically for each participant. This means that researchers can include Django’s built-in template tags and filters in the question text to customize question texts as well as access data accessible through predefined variables. This also works for the briefing and debriefing pages. DDM provides two custom variables to be used: A variable called participant that contains information about the current participant (available in all questions). A variable called data that contains the data donated by the current participant (only available for questions that are related to a file blueprint). The participant related data contains the following information: { \"public_id\": \"S0meLonGCh4rSeQuence\", \"data\": { \"url_param\": { \"parameter_a\": \"value a\", \"parameter_b\": \"value b\" }, \"briefing_consent\": \"1\" # or \"0\" if participant did not consent to take part in the study }, \"donation_info\": { \"n_success\": 1, # number of successfully uploaded blueprints by this participant (regardless of consent). \"n_pending\": 1, # number of pending (i.e., not attempted) blueprint uploads. \"n_failed\": 0, # number of blueprints where an upload was attempted but failed. \"n_consent\": 1, # number of successful uploads to which donation consent was given. \"n_no_consent\": 0, # number of successful uploads to which no donation consent was given. \"n_no_data_extracted\": 0 # number of donations by this participant where all entries were filtered out } } This information can be embedded in any question (i.e., general or blueprint related), any item label, in donation instructions, as well as in the briefing and debriefing text as follows: Dear participant I would like to tell you something about yourself. {% if participant.data.briefing_consent == \"1\" %} You did consent to take part in this study and for this we are really grateful. {% else %} Unfortunately, you did not consent to take part in the study but we respect your decision and completely understand! :') {% endif %} Your public ID is as follows: \"{{ participant.public_id }}\". Please take a photo of this ID. If you wnat to request the deletion of your data at some point in the future you can send an e-mail with your personal public ID to someone@mail.com and your data will be deleted from our servers. A participant that consented to take part in the study will see this question as follows: Dear participant I would like to tell you something about yourself. You did consent to take part in this study and for this we are really grateful. Your public ID is as follows: \"xHQVbrYUYXn5lklW3RGSeouX\". Please take a photo of this ID. If you wnat to request the deletion of your data at some point in the future you can send an e-mail with your personal public ID to someone@mail.com and your data will be deleted from our servers. If a question is related to a file blueprint, the data that was extracted from a participant’s data donation through this file blueprint is available as a template variable called data. As in the case of the participant-related data, the donation-related data can be included in a question text definition following the same logic: This is the title of the last video you watched on YouTube: \"{{ data.0.title }}\" Please indicate below, why you watched this video. This will be rendered as follows: This is the title of the last video you watched on YouTube: \"Data Brokers: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO)\" Please indicate below, why you watched this video. The example above assumes that the donated data is structured as follows: [{'title': 'Data Brokers: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO)', 'timestamp': '2022-12-19T08:49:18'}, {'title': 'Title of second video', 'timestamp': '2022-12-16T11:43:02'}, …​]. If you are starting to construct a dynamic question text, first include the complete data objects stored in the variables in your question text (e.g., {{ participant }}, {{ data }}). Next, open the link to your study in an anonymous browser window and go through the steps until you reach the questionnaire part. This way you can see how the data object is structured and figure out from there, how you can access the information on deeper levels of the data structure. You can then start to adjust the variables and reload the anonymous window every time you made a change to the question definition to see how your new specification will be rendered. Debriefing text Text displayed to participants on the debriefing page. Sometimes you might want to display different debriefing texts depending on the previous actions of your participant (e.g., if a participant did indicate that they do not want to take part in the study, or if a participant did not attempt to donate any data). For this, you can make use of the templating engine and, for example, define the following debriefing page that displays a different text to a participant that did not attempt to donate any that compared to a participant who donated at least some data (the example assumes that two donations were expected in this study): {% if participant.donation_info.n_success > 0 %} Dear participant, Thank you very much for participating in our study. With your data donation, you made a great contribution towards advancing our understanding of algorithmic selection on the internet. {% endif %} {% if participant.donation_info.n_pending == 2 %} Dear participant, Thank you for your time. Because you did not attempt to donate any data, you are unfortunately not eligible to receive the participation reward. {% endif %} You can read more about how to use dynamic templates here. In the Data Center, you can find options to (a) access the collected data, (b) access the project logs, and (c) find some general field statistics about the progress of your project. There are two options to download your data: Internal Download: When you are logged in, click on Download Data as JSON. This will gather your data from the database, and you will be able to download the json file in your browser. External Download via API (advanced option): There is also the possibility to download your data through an API endpoint remotely. For this, an API token has to be created which will need to be supplied when sending the request to the API (see below for an example). Through the admin interface, a project can only be accessed by the user who created it. This means that the internal download is only accessible for a project owner. The API token, on the other hand, can be used to share data access with colleagues working on the same project. However, be careful with whom you share this token as it exposes the sensitive data collected from participants. We recommend choosing a short expiration date for Tokens that you create. When downloading your data, you will receive a .json file with the following structure: { \"project\": { \"pk\": 1, \"name\": \"project name\", \"date_created\": \"2022-12-19T08:49:18.363880+01:00\" }, \"donations\": { \"blueprint name 1\": [ { \"participant\": 1 \"project\": 1, \"time_submitted\": \"2022-12-19T08:49:18.363880+01:00\", \"consent\": true, \"status\": \"success\", # One of \"success\" (donation successful); \"pending\" (donation not attempted); \"failed\" (donation failed due to an error); \"nothing extracted\" (all data filtered out) \"data\": [ { \"extracted_field_1\": \"value1_entry1\", \"extracted_field_2\": \"value2_entry1\", # ... }, { \"extracted_field_1\": \"value1_entry2\", \"extracted_field_2\": \"value2_entry2\", # ... }, # etc. ] } ], \"blueprint name 2\": [ { \"participant\": 1, \"project\": 1, \"time_submitted\": \"...\", # etc. } ] }, \"questionnaire\": [ { \"participant\": 1, \"project\": 1, \"time_submitted\": \"2023-01-19T08:49:18.363880+01:00\", \"responses\": { \"variable_name\": \"answer to question\", \"variable_name-item-value\": \"answer to item\" }, \"meta_data\": { # For data validation purposes: contains one entry per question consisting of meta information about how the question was presented to the participant: \"question-id\": { \"response\": \"1\", # Can be a dict of form {\"item-id\": \"item-response\", ...} for question types with item responses \"question\": \"question text in html format as displayed to participant\", \"items\": [ { \"id\": \"33\", \"label\": \"label text in html format as displayed to participant\", \"label_alt\": \"alternative label text in html format as displayed to participant\", # only applies to semantic differential \"index\": \"1\", \"value\": \"1\", \"randomize\": false } ] } } } ], \"participants\": [ { \"pk\": 1, \"project\": 1, \"external_id\": \"DMXdpfVyksagfqql2cTgp8kF\", \"start_time\": \"2023-01-18T08:49:18.363880+01:00\", \"end_time\": \"2023-01-20T08:49:18.363880+01:00\", \"completed\": true, \"extra_data\": { \"url_param\": { \"some_url_parameter\": \"some value extracted from this parameter when the briefing page was called.\", # ... } } } ] } The Project Log should help researchers to monitor their ongoing data collection and to identify potential problems occurring during the data donation. Two types of logs exist for each project: An Exception Log and an Event Log. The Exception Log lists all exceptions that participants encountered during the study. The log provides the following information: The date and time when the exception occurred The type of the exception (for a description of the type-codes, see here) Which participant encountered the exception (if applicable) For which file blueprint the exception occurred (if applicable) If the exception was raised on the client-side (i.e., the participant’s browser) or the server side A message describing the exception The Event Log currently registers the following events: When an access token is created or deleted When the API endpoint for the project was called but authentication failed or permission was denied When a data download attempt was successful, failed or denied. When a data delete attempt was successful, failed, or denied. When a participant delete request was successful, failed, or denied. The Participation Statistics currently display the following information: Donated Files: The number of successfully donated files. Started: The number of participants that started the study. Completed: The number of participants that reached the debriefing page of the study. Completion Rate: The number of started divided by the number of completed participations. Avrg. to complete: The average time it took a participant from starting the study to reaching the debriefing page. Here, you can find all options that affect the data collected in the course of your project: With this option, you can delete all data collected for a given project. You can delete the data for a given participant by providing their external participation id. You can show your participants their external participation id (also referred to as public_id) during the study (e.g., embedded in a transition block as part of the questionnaire) and inform them that by providing their public ID they can request the deletion of their data in the future if they change their mind. This function can then help you to delete a participant from the database (if your study is still ongoing at the time a participant requests the deletion of their data). See here for an example of how this could be done. With this option you can delete the current project. This will also delete all associated data.","title":"Documentation for Researchers","component":"ddm","version":"v1.0.19","name":"for_researchers","url":"/ddm/v1.0.19/for_researchers.html","titles":[{"text":"Setting Up a Data Donation Project","hash":"_setting_up_a_data_donation_project","id":1},{"text":"Creating a Project","hash":"_creating_a_project","id":2},{"text":"The Project Hub","hash":"_the_project_hub","id":3},{"text":"Editing Project Details","hash":"_editing_project_details","id":4},{"text":"Base Settings","hash":"_base_settings","id":5},{"text":"Public Project Information","hash":"_public_project_information","id":6},{"text":"URL Parameter Extraction","hash":"_url_parameter_extraction","id":7},{"text":"Redirect Configuration","hash":"_redirect_configuration","id":8},{"text":"Project Appearance","hash":"_project_appearance","id":9},{"text":"Editing Project Configuration","hash":"_editing_project_configuration","id":10},{"text":"Briefing","hash":"_briefing","id":11},{"text":"Data Donation","hash":"_data_donation","id":12},{"text":"Configure File Uploader","hash":"_configure_file_uploader","id":13},{"text":"Configure Instructions","hash":"_configure_instructions","id":14},{"text":"Configure Donation Blueprint","hash":"_configure_donation_blueprint","id":15},{"text":"JSON specific settings","hash":"_json_specific_settings","id":16},{"text":"CSV specific settings","hash":"_csv_specific_settings","id":17},{"text":"Extraction Rules","hash":"_extraction_rules","id":18},{"text":"Questionnaire","hash":"_questionnaire","id":19},{"text":"How the Questionnaire Works","hash":"_how_the_questionnaire_works","id":20},{"text":"Question Configuration Settings","hash":"_question_configuration_settings","id":21},{"text":"Question Items","hash":"_question_items","id":22},{"text":"Scale Configuration","hash":"_scale_configuration","id":23},{"text":"Including Data Dynamically in a Question","hash":"_including_data_dynamically_in_a_question","id":24},{"text":"Participant-Related Data","hash":"_participant_related_data","id":25},{"text":"Donation-Related Data","hash":"_donation_related_data","id":26},{"text":"Debriefing","hash":"_debriefing","id":27},{"text":"Data Center","hash":"_data_center","id":28},{"text":"Data Download: Accessing Collected Data Donations","hash":"_data_download_accessing_collected_data_donations","id":29},{"text":"Data Structure","hash":"_data_structure","id":30},{"text":"Project Log: Monitoring an on-going Project","hash":"_project_log_monitoring_an_on_going_project","id":31},{"text":"Exception Log","hash":"_exception_log","id":32},{"text":"Event Log","hash":"_event_log","id":33},{"text":"Participation Statistics","hash":"_participation_statistics","id":34},{"text":"Danger Zone","hash":"_danger_zone","id":35},{"text":"Reset Project Data","hash":"_reset_project_data","id":36},{"text":"Delete Participant","hash":"_delete_participant","id":37},{"text":"Delete Project","hash":"_delete_project","id":38}]},"22":{"id":22,"text":"DDM DDM Documentation DDM (Data Donation Module) is an open-source Django/web application that helps researchers to set up data donation projects and to collect data donations for academic research. The application is intended to be hosted at an institutional level (e.g., a university, a university division, or a research conglomerate) as it provides the possibility to host multiple independent data donation projects simultaneously. Nevertheless, it is also possible to use it for single projects. It is developed by the Media Use and Effects Division at the University of Zurich. The Data Donation Module is embedded in the Data Donation Lab, a larger initiative of the University of Zurich and the Digital Society Initiative to strengthen the exchange about the topic of data donations and promote this data collection approach. For more information, visit https://datadonation.uzh.ch. This project is currently under active development. The Data Donation Module enables researchers to setup a data donation project that, from the participants' perspective, consists of the following steps: 1) Briefing Page At the beginning, participants are presented with a briefing page. On this page, researchers can describe their project, brief participants about the upcoming steps, and optionally obtain explicit consent for participation. 2) Data Donation Next, participants are presented with a user interface through which they can donate their data. This interface consists of (1) a set of instructions, (2) a data upload form, and (3) a feedback area. The participation flow in this step looks as follows: The participant reads the instructions and downloads/finds the relevant file on their PC. The participant uploads their data with the provided upload form. The uploaded data is filtered and transformed according to the rules defined by the researcher (e.g., only certain fields are extracted). The participant is presented with the filtered/transformed data which they will be donating to the researchers. Based on d, the participant can decide whether to donate their data (i.e., submit their data to the reseacher’s server). Steps b to d are all client-based and executed in the participant’s browser. No personal data is submitted until step e. 3) Follow-Up Questionnaire (optional) After the data donation, participants can optionally be presented with a questionnaire. Questions defined in this questionnaire can be configured to include data points from the donated data – either to enrich the donated data or to provide participants with insights into their personal data. 4) End/Debriefing Page Lastly, participants are presented with a debriefing page. From here, participants can optionally be redirected to another website or web application. Different parts of the documentation are targeted at different user groups of the application. Documentation for Researchers: This section is for researchers who use DDM to set up their data donation projects on an existing application server. Documentation for Administrator: This section is for server administrators who want to set up a server to host DDM. Documentation for Developers: This section is for developers who want to contribute to the development of DDM or want to fork and extend DDM on their own. Furthermore, the section Topic References contains more detailed information on various specialized topics.","title":"DDM Documentation","component":"ddm","version":"v1.0.19","name":"index","url":"/ddm/v1.0.19/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview of DDM","hash":"_overview_of_ddm","id":1},{"text":"Core Functionality","hash":"_core_functionality","id":2},{"text":"Documentation Structure","hash":"_documentation_structure","id":3}]},"23":{"id":23,"text":"DDM Reporting Issues and Getting Help If you encounter issues or detect a bug, please open a new issue in the GitHub repository.

The default admin templates include a minimalistic header and footer that do not integrate any actions related to a researchers user account because authentication is handled by the main website (see User Authentication). However, for your own project you may wish to replace the default header and/or footer within the admin interface to include your own branding and provide your users with some account management options such as a logout button. This can be done by using Django’s template inheritance. In your application create a new html template your_application/templates/ddm/admin/base.html. In this file, you can overwrite the header and/or footer as follows: {% extends \"ddm/admin/base.html\" %} {% block extrahead %} <!-- If you wish, you can integrate custom css files, favicon etc. here --> {% endblock %} {% block header %} <div> <!-- Your Custom Header HTML --> </div> {% endblock %} {% block footer %} <div> <!-- Your Custom Footer HTML --> </div> {% endblock %} This pages aims to describe what types of encryption should be used by the system hosting this module and what is implemented in this module. It is site-level responsibility to setup encryption in transit, like SSL/TLS for all communication between clients and the server. For some hints on how this should be setup, start with the Django docs. We minimize the amount of potential data that is processed on the server, by doing most of the filtering client-side. Do take into account that ideally the connection from system to the database is secured as well, and that the database is stored on an encrypted system. The module stores all data in encrypted fields in the database, the encryption/decryption procedure is described below. Each project has a unique salt that is generated when creating the project. In the Django site settings, we use the SECRET_KEY as the default passphrase for encryption. If a project is working with sensitive data, we recommend that a project specific password is set. This password is only known by the person setting it and should not be shared. A project specific password will limit the functionality of the module for a given project: it won’t be possible to create followup questions based on the data donation. We use a hybrid asymmetric/symmetric encryption approach, due to the size limitation of the pure asymmetric approach. The following steps occur in the encryption process - generate a public key and store it in the project (if none exists) - generate a session key used for encrypting a single message - encrypt the data symmetrically using the session key - encrypt the session key using the public key asymmetrically - store the encrypted data with the encrypted key as header The following steps occur in the decryption process - generate a private key - get the desired encrypted data from the project - decrypt the encrypted session key (header) asymmetrically using the private key - decrypt the data using the decrypted session key symmetrically For encryption we only need the public key; - Check if we have a public key that is saved for the project - if not, we should have gotten a passphrase and a salt with which we can generate a public key. — generate the private key — derive the public key — save the public key for the project - We then use PKCS#1 OAEP for the wrapping and OAEP padding. For decryption we need the private key; - Using the supplied passphrase and salt, we generate a 128bit HMAC digest, which we use to populate a pseudo-random number generator. - This random number generator is used to generate our RSA key. - We then use PKCS#1 OAEP for wrapping the OAEP padding. There are significant limitations on the size of the data that can be encrypted using asymmetric algorithms and severe performance penalties. This is why we combine this with symmetric encryption. In our case we use AES to encrypt the actual data. The Data Donation Module uses the default Django user management to authenticate users. For production use in the context of an academic institution we recommend implementing authentication through an academic authentication infrastructure with OpenID Connect (OIDC) - see below. In the case of single user instances, i.e., if DDM is installed and deployed to only support one specific project, this step is not necessary. TODO: Explain creation of researcher profiles: 1. Login/Register through default authentication → 2. Create a DDM research profile associated to authenticated account → 3. redirect to ddm projects For authentication to work properly make sure you do the following in your main site: Define a login and logout view in urls.py: from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views urlpatterns = [ # ... path('login/', auth_views.LoginView.as_view(template_name='myapp/login.html'), name='ddm-login'), path('logout/', auth_views.LogoutView.as_view(), name='ddm-logout'), ] Either, you define your own template ('myapp/login.html'), or you can reuse or customize the default DDM login template ('ddm/admin/auth/login.html' or 'ddm/admin/auth/login_oidc.html' if you use OIDC authentication). Define Proper redirect paths in your settings.py: # Paths to redirect after login/logout LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/auth/researcher/' LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = '/login/' We recommend using the package mozilla-django-oidc for OIDC authentication. To enable OIDC authentication with mozilla-django-oidc, follow these steps (see also the official mozilla-django-oidc documentation): Setup a client with an OpenID provider. Install mozilla-django-oidc: pip install mozilla-django-oidc Next, adjust your settings.py. Add 'mozilla_django_oidc' to INSTALLED_APPS after 'django.contrib.auth':: INSTALLED_APPS = ( # ... 'django.contrib.auth', 'mozilla_django_oidc', # ... ) Add 'mozilla_django_oidc' authentication backend:: AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = ( 'mozilla_django_oidc.auth.OIDCAuthenticationBackend', # ... ) Add the following settings:: # API values retrieved from OIDC provider: OIDC_RP_CLIENT_ID = os.environ['OIDC_RP_CLIENT_ID'] OIDC_RP_CLIENT_SECRET = os.environ['OIDC_RP_CLIENT_SECRET'] # Look the following values up in your OIDC provider's documentation: OIDC_OP_AUTHORIZATION_ENDPOINT = '<URL of the OIDC OP authorization endpoint>' OIDC_OP_TOKEN_ENDPOINT = '<URL of the OIDC OP token endpoint>' OIDC_OP_USER_ENDPOINT = '<URL of the OIDC OP userinfo endpoint>' Update urls.py:: urlpatterns = [ # ... path('oidc/', include('mozilla_django_oidc.urls')), # ... ] Enable token renewal by adding the following to your middlewares in settings.py:: MIDDLEWARE = [ # middleware involving session and authentication must come first # ...

Exception Message: TODO To be implemented The administration interface for researchers currently only supports English. The participation interface currently supports English and German. The language in which the interface for participants is displayed is determined by the default language of the participant’s browser. If a language is not implemented for the participant interface, it is displayed in English. To add support for a new language, new locales must be added at two locations: Translations for the Django part of DDM are located at /ddm/locale/. An extensive description of how translation is handled by Django can be found here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/i18n/translation/ To create the translation files, first run django-admin makemessages -l de in the ddm directory, where de is the locale name that you want to create. This command creates or updates a file located at ddm/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/django.po. In this file, you can add your translations. Afterwards, run django-admin compilemessages to create a django.mo file, which will be used by gettext for translation. The translation files for the vue components are located at /frontend/src/translations/. Here, support for a new language can be added by appending the respective locale name as a first-level key to the json files and adding corresponding translations for all translation blocks. Oftentimes, it can take some time between requesting a data takeout from a platform and actually being able to download this takeout. Therefore, researchers might want to provide their study participants with the possibility to pause their participation and continue with the study as soon as they were able to download their personal data takeout. To enable this, DDM offers a continuation endpoint through which participants can resume their participation. This endpoint is a URL containing the project url identifier as well as the external participant ID passed as a URL parameter p. This URL looks as follows: https://your-domain.com/project-slug/continue?p=ExternalParticipantID You can display this continuation link in the instructions to your participants by utilizing the Django templating functionality (described here) as follows: https.//your-domain.com/project-slug/continue?p={{ participant.public_id }} DDM offers several interfaces to retrieve different parts of the data collected for a given project. For example, it is possible to retrieve only the data donations, only the questionnaire responses, or the complete data including data donations, questionnaire responses and metadata. This can be useful to, for example: access specific parts of the data collected for a project directly from within your R- or Python-analysis scripts. provide your participants with a personalized dashboard or report containing personalized insights based on the data they just donated to a project. This can serve as a great incentive for participation. build custom dashboards to track the progress of your data collection in more detail. For this, DDM implements RESTful APIs. Currently, only GET requests are allowed through these endpoints. The APIs listed here can be accessed using Token authentication. A Token is always associated to a specific project and must be created through the web application (on the main project site, go to the Project Hub and in the Data Center click on Manage Access Token). Token expiration can be set to a maximum of 90 days after which they must be renewed. Description Download all data collected for a given donation project.

It is site-level responsibility to setup encryption in transit, like SSL/TLS for all communication between clients and the server. For some hints on how this should be setup, start with the Django docs. We minimize the amount of potential data that is processed on the server, by doing most of the filtering client-side. Do take into account that ideally the connection from system to the database is secured as well, and that the database is stored on an encrypted system. The module stores all data in encrypted fields in the database, the encryption/decryption procedure is described below. Each project has a unique salt that is generated when creating the project. In the Django site settings, we use the SECRET_KEY as the default passphrase for encryption. If a project is working with sensitive data, we recommend that a project specific password is set. This password is only known by the person setting it and should not be shared. A project specific password will limit the functionality of the module for a given project: it won’t be possible to create followup questions based on the data donation. We use a hybrid asymmetric/symmetric encryption approach, due to the size limitation of the pure asymmetric approach. The following steps occur in the encryption process - generate a public key and store it in the project (if none exists) - generate a session key used for encrypting a single message - encrypt the data symmetrically using the session key - encrypt the session key using the public key asymmetrically - store the encrypted data with the encrypted key as header The following steps occur in the decryption process - generate a private key - get the desired encrypted data from the project - decrypt the encrypted session key (header) asymmetrically using the private key - decrypt the data using the decrypted session key symmetrically For encryption we only need the public key; - Check if we have a public key that is saved for the project - if not, we should have gotten a passphrase and a salt with which we can generate a public key. — generate the private key — derive the public key — save the public key for the project - We then use PKCS#1 OAEP for the wrapping and OAEP padding. For decryption we need the private key; - Using the supplied passphrase and salt, we generate a 128bit HMAC digest, which we use to populate a pseudo-random number generator. - This random number generator is used to generate our RSA key. - We then use PKCS#1 OAEP for wrapping the OAEP padding. There are significant limitations on the size of the data that can be encrypted using asymmetric algorithms and severe performance penalties. This is why we combine this with symmetric encryption. In our case we use AES to encrypt the actual data.","title":"","component":"ddm","version":"v1.0.19","name":"encryption","url":"/ddm/v1.0.19/topics/encryption.html","titles":[{"text":"Encryption in transit and at rest","hash":"_encryption_in_transit_and_at_rest","id":1},{"text":"Encryption in transit","hash":"_encryption_in_transit","id":2},{"text":"Encryption at rest","hash":"_encryption_at_rest","id":3},{"text":"Encryption and decryption process","hash":"_encryption_and_decryption_process","id":4},{"text":"Steps","hash":"_steps","id":5},{"text":"Asymmetric Key Generation and process","hash":"_asymmetric_key_generation_and_process","id":6},{"text":"Symmetric Key Generation and process","hash":"_symmetric_key_generation_and_process","id":7}]},"33":{"id":33,"text":"This page describes the implemented exceptions that are logged in a project’s exception log.

It is developed by the Media Use and Effects Division at the University of Zurich. The Data Donation Module is embedded in the Data Donation Lab, a larger initiative of the University of Zurich and the Digital Society Initiative to strengthen the exchange about the topic of data donations and promote this data collection approach. For more information, visit https://datadonation.uzh.ch. The Data Donation Module enables researchers to setup a data donation project that, from the participants' perspective, consists of the following steps: 1) Briefing Page At the beginning, participants are presented with a briefing page. On this page, researchers can describe their project, brief participants about the upcoming steps, and optionally obtain explicit consent for participation. 2) Data Donation Next, participants are presented with a user interface through which they can donate their data. This interface consists of (1) a set of instructions, (2) a data upload form, and (3) a feedback area. The participation flow in this step looks as follows: The participant reads the instructions and downloads/finds the relevant file on their PC. The participant uploads their data with the provided upload form. The uploaded data is filtered and transformed according to the rules defined by the researcher (e.g., only certain fields are extracted). The participant is presented with the filtered/transformed data which they will be donating to the researchers. Based on d, the participant can decide whether to donate their data (i.e., submit their data to the reseacher’s server). Steps b to d are all client-based and executed in the participant’s browser. No personal data is submitted until step e. 3) Follow-Up Questionnaire (optional) After the data donation, participants can optionally be presented with a questionnaire. Questions defined in this questionnaire can be configured to include data points from the donated data – either to enrich the donated data or to provide participants with insights into their personal data. 4) End/Debriefing Page Lastly, participants are presented with a debriefing page. From here, participants can optionally be redirected to another website or web application. The application is intended to be hosted at an institutional level (e.g., a university, a university division, or a research conglomerate) as it provides the possibility to host multiple independent data donation projects simultaneously. Nevertheless, it is also possible to use it for single projects. For users (i.e., researchers), DDM is designed to be as easy to use as possible. Everything can be configured through a graphical user interface without requiring programming knowledge. Read more about DDM and its design philosophies in the accompanying article \"Data Donation Module: A Web Application for Collecting and Enriching Data Donations\" by N. Pfiffner, P. Witlox, and T.

ProjectPath> python -m venv /path/to/venv Then you can activate the environment as follows: ProjectPath> source /path/to/venv/bin/activate (venv) ProjectPath> Next, install Django in your virtual environment: (venv) ProjectPath> pip install Django==4.2.* Now that Django is installed, start a new project and access it: (venv) ProjectPath> django-admin startproject yourproject (venv) ProjectPath> cd yourproject This will create a new folder yourproject that contains a file called manage.py and a folder that is also called yourproject. In this subfolder you will find, among others, the settings.py and the urls.py file. Next, create a superuser account with your Django project: (venv) ProjectPath/yourproject> python manage.py createsuperuser You will be asked to provide a username and a password. To see whether the installation of Django worked run the following command and see whether the base site loads: (venv) ProjectPath/yourproject> python manage.py runserver Install the Django DDM package: (venv) ProjectPath/yourproject> pip install django-ddm Next, you will have to adjust several sections of your settings.py and urls.py files. First, add the necessary entries to INSTALLED_APPS in your settings.py: # settings.py INSTALLED_APPS = [ # ..., 'ddm', 'ddm.auth', 'ddm.logging', 'ddm.questionnaire', 'ddm.datadonation', 'ddm.participation', 'ddm.projects', 'ddm.core', 'django_ckeditor_5', 'webpack_loader', 'rest_framework', 'rest_framework.authtoken', ] Add the following configuration for webpack-loader to your settings.py: # settings.py # For production use: import os WEBPACK_LOADER = { 'DEFAULT': { 'CACHE': True, 'BUNDLE_DIR_NAME': 'ddm_core/vue/', 'STATS_FILE': os.path.join(STATIC_ROOT, 'ddm_core/vue/webpack-stats.json'), 'POLL_INTERVAL': 0.1, 'IGNORE': [r'.+\\.hot-update.js', r'.+\\.map'], } } # For development use: import os import ddm.core WEBPACK_LOADER = { 'DEFAULT': { 'CACHE': False, 'BUNDLE_DIR_NAME': 'core/vue/', 'STATS_FILE': os.path.join( os.path.dirname(ddm.core.__file__), 'static/ddm_core/vue/webpack-stats.json' ), 'POLL_INTERVAL': 0.1, # Adjust as needed 'IGNORE': [r'.+\\.hot-update.js', r'.+\\.map'], } } Add the DDM context processor to your template context processors. This will enable the version indicator of the currently used DDM distribution below the header in the admin interface. # settings.py TEMPLATES = [ { 'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates', 'DIRS': ['templates'], 'APP_DIRS': True, 'OPTIONS': { 'context_processors': [ # ... 'ddm.core.context_processors.add_ddm_version' # Add this. ], }, }, ] Configure CKEditor settings in your settings.py to allow your users to upload images, videos and PDFs in instructions and question texts (see https://github.com/hvlads/django-ckeditor-5 for further information): # settings.py CKEDITOR_5_FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION = 'authenticated' CKEDITOR_5_ALLOW_ALL_FILE_TYPES = True CKEDITOR_5_UPLOAD_FILE_TYPES = ['jpeg', 'pdf', 'png', 'mp4'] Add time zone support to your settings.py: # settings.py USE_TZ = True Optionally, an e-mail address restriction can be defined in settings.py. Only users whose e-mail address matches the defined regex pattern will be allowed to set up data donation projects: # settings.py DDM_SETTINGS = { 'EMAIL_PERMISSION_CHECK': r'.*(\\.|@)somedomain\\.com$', }, Include the DDM urls in your projects urls.py: # urls.py from django.urls import path, include # ... urlpatterns = [ # ... path('ddm/', include('ddm.core.urls')), ] Configure login and logout endpoints for DDM in urls.py: # urls.py from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views from django.urls import path, include # ... urlpatterns = [ # ... path('ddm/', include('ddm.core.urls')), path('login/', auth_views.LoginView.as_view(template_name='ddm_auth/login.html'), name='ddm_login'), # You can choose whatever path and template you like path('logout/', auth_views.LogoutView.as_view(), name='ddm_logout'), # You can choose whatever path and template you like path('ckeditor5/', include('django_ckeditor_5.urls')), # This is the endpoint that handles file uploads through the CKEditor. ] If you use DDM on a Django site together with wagtail, and you have internationalization enabled for your wagtail urls, we recommend to use the prefix_default_language=False for the i18n_patterns: # urls.py from django.conf.urls.i18n import i18n_patterns from django.urls import path, include from wagtail import urls as wagtail_urls # ... urlpatterns = [ # ... ] urlpatterns += i18n_patterns( path('', include(wagtail_urls)), prefix_default_language=False ) Not doing this will cause ddm.tests.test_apis.test_participant_deletion_with_regular_login to fail. In practice, the participant API still seems to work properly despite the test failing, however, unexpected behaviour cannot be ruled out at this point. This will be fixed in a future version. The Python installation includes SQLite which is configured to be used as a database backend in the standard settings.py created by Django. For a development environment, this SQLite is totally fine, however for a production deployment you should consider configuring a more robust and efficient database such as PostgreSQL or MariaDB (see the Django Documentation for further information). Once you have configured a database, run python manage.py migrate to create the ddm models in your database. To test if your installation was successful, run python manage.py test ddm. Next, run python manage.py runserver to start the server locally. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin to ensure that the Data Donation Module is listed as a subsection in the administration interface. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ddm/projects to see whether you can access the ddm project overview site and try to create a new project. You can provide default images to be included in the header of the participation views. These images will be displayed by default, but can be overwritten on a project-basis by researchers in the project settings. To enable default images, provide the paths to the images that you want to display in the left and/or right part of the public header in your settings.py as follows: # settings.py DDM_DEFAULT_HEADER_IMG_LEFT = '/path/to/logo_left.png' DDM_DEFAULT_HEADER_IMG_RIGHT = '/path/to/logo_right.png' DDM uses a custom CKEditor toolbar for instruction and question text definitions that can optionally be customized (find out more) Official Django Documentation Official Python Documentation Django Tutorials on W3Schools or Digital Ocean Information for developers in this documentation","title":"Installation Guide","component":"ddm","version":"develop","name":"installation","url":"/ddm/develop/administrators/installation.html","titles":[{"text":"Requirements","hash":"_requirements","id":1},{"text":"Create Django Application","hash":"_create_django_application","id":2},{"text":"Install DDM","hash":"_install_ddm","id":3},{"text":"Update Settings.py","hash":"_update_settings_py","id":4},{"text":"Update urls.py","hash":"_update_urls_py","id":5},{"text":"Apply Database Migrations","hash":"_apply_database_migrations","id":6},{"text":"Test Installation","hash":"_test_installation","id":7},{"text":"Optional Settings","hash":"_optional_settings","id":8},{"text":"Default Header Images","hash":"_default_header_images","id":9},{"text":"Customizing CKEditor","hash":"_customizing_ckeditor","id":10},{"text":"Further Resources","hash":"_further_resources","id":11}]},"41":{"id":41,"text":"DDM Developers This section of the documentation is targeted at people who contribute to the development of DDM or who want to learn more about its development in general. The repository includes a django test project that can be used for local development and testing. Once you have cloned or forked the GitHub repository, activate your local virtual environment and install the following requirements: (venv) <...>/ddm> pip install -r requirements.txt A basic standard configuration for the test project is specified in test_project/test_config.json. Adjust the information in this file if you want to use a custom setup, or use another database. By default, the test project uses SQLite as a database backend. If you do make changes to this file, please do NOT commit these changes to the shared repository. Through the setup described above, the regular django commands are now available: To start the development server use the following commands: (venv) <...>/ddm/test_project> python manage.py runserver To create new migrations based on the changes made to the models, run: (venv) <...>/ddm/test_project> python manage.py makemigrations To apply existing migrations to your local database, run: [1] (venv) <...>/ddm/test_project> python manage.py migrate To run unit tests, use: (venv) <...>/ddm/test_project> python manage.py test ddm First, install the appropriate node.js version according to the .node-version file. Then, install the node dependencies: (venv) <...>/ddm/frontend> npm install To run the app in development mode, you will need to serve both Django’s dev server and the webpack development server: From the frontend directory, run: (venv) <...>/ddm/frontend> npm run serve And, in a separate terminal in the Django root directory, run the Django development server: (venv) <...>/ddm/test_project> python manage.py runserver Open your locally hosted Django app in a browser (e.g. http://localhost:8000). Changes to the vue code will trigger an automatic reload of the page in the browser. When it is time to deploy, or when you simply want to omit running the Vue dev server, you can build the Vue project in production mode. Cancel the npm run serve process if it is running and instead run npm run build. The optimized bundles will be built in and placed into the Django static file location, and webpack-stats.json will be updated to reflect this new configuration. The vue builds should end up in the static folder of the django module (ddm/static). This project uses GitHub actions for automated testing and CI tasks. A push to develop triggers build tests for the following configurations: Python: [3.8, 3.10.4] Database: [sqlite, mysql] A tag (vX.X.X) push to develop triggers build tests (see above). If the tests are successful develop is automatically merged into main. Please make sure that pushed tags are in sync with package versions on PyPi. If the build-tests of a pushed tag fail, delete the tag[2] and push the fixed version again with the same tag until the tests run through. A push to main triggers build tests and if the tests are successful, automatically bumps the version number (patch number) and builds a new PyPi package. The tests have the same configurations as on develop. A pull request to main created by dependabot will automatically update the affected dependencies and merge into main. A regular push to develop triggers the following pipeline: Run tests on develop. Create new documentation for GitHub pages. A tag (\"vX.X.X\") push to develop triggers the following pipeline: Run tests on develop. Create new documentation for GitHub pages. Merge develop into main. Run tests on main. Create PyPi package. A pull request to main created by dependabot triggers the following pipeline: Update dependencies. Merge into main. Run tests on main. Create PyPi package. A new release is created manually and includes: Bumping the minor or major part of the version. Updating setup.cfg. Ideally, add a changelog. This documentation is written in AsciiDoc and compiled using Antora. The documentation UI uses the Antora DDM UI which is based on the default Antora UI. To compile the documentation locally, you first need to install Antora following these instructions. Next, you can compile the documentation locally using the antora-playbook-local.yml file: (venv) <...>/ddm/docs> npx antora antora-playbook-local.yml Inspect the compiled documentation by opening <…​>/ddm/docs/build/index.html in your preferred browser. document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function(event) { let url = window.location.href; let els = document.getElementsByClassName('nav-link'); Array.prototype.forEach.call(els, function(e) { let href = e.href; if (url === href) { e.classList.add('active'); } }) }); 1. If you are running a version of Python < 3.9, you might have to manually enable the JSON1 extension on SQLite for the migration to work properly.

Some words of caution: After a project has been created, it cannot be changed from super secret to regular and vice versa. There is no way to recover or reset the password used to initialize the super secret project in case it gets lost. Making a project \"super secret\" will limit the functionality of the module: it won’t be possible to create follow-up questions based on the data donation (i.e., data points from the data donation cannot be referenced in a question).

Project Settings Overview Each of these sections contains a set of settings that are described below. Project Name The name of the project. Visible to participants in the browser’s title bar or a page’s tab. URL Identifier The URL Identifier is a string that is added to the participation URL (e.g, www.some.url/project-slug). Your participants will take part in your project via this URL. The URL Identifier Can only contain letters, hyphens, numbers or underscores. Active Set a project to active or inactive. Participants can only take part in an active project. If participants open the link to an inactive project, they will be redirected to an information page telling them that participation in this project is currently not possible. This information will be accessible to your participants during all participation steps. Contact Information Contact information of the researcher responsible for the project. The contact information is linked in the footer of the participation interface and can be viewed by participants at any stage of the data donation process. Data Protection Statement Data protection statement that describes how the data is processed. The data protection statement is linked in the footer of the participation interface and can be viewed by participants at any stage of the data donation process. Information can be extracted from parameters passed with the URL when a project is accessed by a participant (e.g., www.some.url/project-slug?parameter_A=someId&parameter_B=socialMedia). This setting is optional. There are several scenarios, where you will want to make use of URL parameter extraction. For example: External questionnaire: If participants are asked to first fill out a questionnaire created in an external survey software such as, e.g. Unipark or Qualtrics, passing URL parameters can be used to link data donations with the survey data by passing a participant ID in the URL parameters. External recruitment partner: When you work together with an external recruitment partner (e.g., an access panel), you will usually need to extract the participants' identifiers from the URL. Tracking recruitment channels: When you recruit participants through different channels (e.g., social media, e-mail, or leaflets) you can use URL parameters to identify where your participants are coming from. The URL Parameter extraction can be configured using the following settings: URL parameter extraction enabled Enable or disable whether URL parameters should be extracted when participants access the project’s briefing page. Expected URL parameter Provide a string containing the parameters that should be extracted. Separate multiple parameters with a semicolon (e.g., \"parameter_A;parameter_B\"). The extracted values will be saved for each participant and is included in the data export. If a parameter is not present, it will be saved as None. Undefined parameters passed in the URL will be ignored. Participants can be redirected to another website from the debriefing page (this is optional). This can be configured using the following settings: Redirect enabled Enable or disable the redirection of your participants when they have completed your project. If enabled, a redirect button will be displayed on the data donation end page that redirects to the URL defined in the Redirect target setting. Redirect address The URL to which participants will be redirected (only required if redirect is enabled). The redirect URL can include information on the participant and the project ID. For this, you can use variables that are populated with the respective values. Currently, the following variables are supported: The participant data is accessible with {{ participant }}` and the project ID can be inserted with `{{ project_id }}`. E.g., `https://redirect.url?param={{url_parameter.URLParameter+}}&participant={{participant_id}}&project={{project_id}} See this section for more information on the variable inclusion. You can customize the general appearance of your donation project by providing up to two logos that will be displayed in the header of your project.

For production use in the context of an academic institution we recommend implementing authentication through an academic authentication infrastructure with OpenID Connect (OIDC) - see below. In the case of single user instances, i.e., if DDM is installed and deployed to only support one specific project, this step is not necessary. TODO: Explain creation of researcher profiles: 1. Login/Register through default authentication → 2. Create a DDM research profile associated to authenticated account → 3. redirect to ddm projects For authentication to work properly make sure you do the following in your main site: Define a login and logout view in urls.py: from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views urlpatterns = [ # ... path('login/', auth_views.LoginView.as_view(template_name='myapp/login.html'), name='ddm_login'), path('logout/', auth_views.LogoutView.as_view(), name='ddm_logout'), ] Either, you define your own template ('myapp/login.html'), or you can reuse or customize the default DDM login template ('ddm_auth/login.html' or 'ddm_auth/login_oidc.html' if you use OIDC authentication). Define Proper redirect paths in your settings.py: # Paths to redirect after login/logout LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/auth/researcher/' LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = '/login/' We recommend using the package mozilla-django-oidc for OIDC authentication. To enable OIDC authentication with mozilla-django-oidc, follow these steps (see also the official mozilla-django-oidc documentation): Setup a client with an OpenID provider.

It is site-level responsibility to setup encryption in transit, like SSL/TLS for all communication between clients and the server. For some hints on how this should be setup, start with the Django docs. We minimize the amount of potential data that is processed on the server, by doing most of the filtering client-side. Do take into account that ideally the connection from system to the database is secured as well, and that the database is stored on an encrypted system. The module stores all data in encrypted fields in the database, the encryption/decryption procedure is described below. Each project has a unique salt that is generated when creating the project. In the Django site settings, we use the SECRET_KEY as the default passphrase for encryption. If a project is working with sensitive data, we recommend that a project specific password is set. This password is only known by the person setting it and should not be shared. A project specific password will limit the functionality of the module for a given project: it won’t be possible to create follow-up questions based on the data donation. We use a hybrid asymmetric/symmetric encryption approach, due to the size limitation of the pure asymmetric approach. The encryption process consists of the following steps: - generate a public key and store it in the project (if none exists) - generate a session key used for encrypting a single message - encrypt the data symmetrically using the session key - encrypt the session key using the public key asymmetrically - store the encrypted data with the encrypted key as header The decryption process consists of the following steps: - generate a private key - get the desired encrypted data from the project - decrypt the encrypted session key (header) asymmetrically using the private key - decrypt the data using the decrypted session key symmetrically For encryption we only need the public key; - Check if we have a public key that is saved for the project - if not, we should have gotten a passphrase and a salt with which we can generate a public key. — generate the private key — derive the public key — save the public key for the project - We then use PKCS#1 OAEP for the wrapping and OAEP padding. For decryption we need the private key; - Using the supplied passphrase and salt, we generate a 128bit HMAC digest, which we use to populate a pseudo-random number generator. - This random number generator is used to generate our RSA key. - We then use PKCS#1 OAEP for wrapping the OAEP padding. There are significant limitations on the size of the data that can be encrypted using asymmetric algorithms and severe performance penalties. This is why we combine this with symmetric encryption. In our case we use AES to encrypt the actual data.","title":"Data Encryption","component":"ddm","version":"develop","name":"encryption","url":"/ddm/develop/developers/topics/encryption.html","titles":[{"text":"Encryption in transit and at rest","hash":"_encryption_in_transit_and_at_rest","id":1},{"text":"Encryption in transit","hash":"_encryption_in_transit","id":2},{"text":"Encryption at rest","hash":"_encryption_at_rest","id":3},{"text":"Encryption and decryption process","hash":"_encryption_and_decryption_process","id":4},{"text":"Steps","hash":"_steps","id":5},{"text":"Asymmetric Key Generation and process","hash":"_asymmetric_key_generation_and_process","id":6},{"text":"Symmetric Key Generation and process","hash":"_symmetric_key_generation_and_process","id":7}]},"57":{"id":57,"text":"DDM Developers Topics Internationalization The administration interface for researchers currently only supports English.

This command creates or updates a file located at ddm/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/django.po. In this file, you can add your translations. Afterward, run django-admin compilemessages to create a django.mo file, which will be used by gettext for translation. The translation files for the vue components are located at /frontend/src/translations/.

Participation Overview Download This will download a CSV file containing one row for every participant that has started participation in the project (i.e., this also contains participants that have not completed the donation). The file includes the following variables: Variable/Column Description participant_id The ID of the participant. start_time Date and time in ISO 8601 format when the participant first accessed the project (e.g., \"2024-07-16 20:30:40.863581+00:00\"). end_time Date and time in ISO 8601 format when the participant accessed the debriefing page of the project (e.g., \"2024-07-16 22:25:30.1634581+00:00\"). current_step The last step of the participation flow that the participant has accessed (\"1\" = Briefing page, \"2\" = data donation step, \"3\" = questionnaire, \"4\" = debriefing page). completed Indicates whether the participant has completed the participation (True/False). extra_data Contains any extra data recorded in relation to a participation (e.g., extracted URL parameters). blueprint_<X>_name The name of the blueprint with ID \"X\". blueprint_<X>_time_submitted Date and time in ISO 8601 format when the participant has submitted their donation for blueprint X. blueprint_<X>_consent Indicates whether the participant has consented to the donation of their data related to blueprint X. blueprint_<X>_status Indicates the status of the participant’s donation in relation to blueprint X (\"success\" = donation was successful, \"pending\" = data donation step reached but donation not attempted, \"failed\" = donation attempted but donation failed due to an error, \"nothing extracted\" = all data filtered out) donation_download_link A link though which the donation for the participant can be downloaded. Can be opened in the browser where you are logged in to DDM. Next, you can download the data donations for each participant through the donation download link. For larger donation projects where you collect data donations from many participants, it may be more convenient to download the data donations through the API (see below). To download the questionnaire responses as a csv table, go to the Project Hub, scroll down to the section \"Data Center\" and download the file by clicking on Download CSV: Figure 3. Questionnaire Responses Download To download your data via the API, you first have to create an API token. You can do so by going to the \"Data Center\" section in your Project Hub, and then clicking on \"Manage Access Token\". In the page that opens you can create an API token that is used to authenticate your external download request. A list of available API endpoints and a more detailed description on how to use them can be found in the API section of the documentation. Through the admin interface, a project can only be accessed by the user who created it. This means that the internal download is only accessible for a project owner. The API token, on the other hand, can be used to share data access with colleagues working on the same project. However, be careful with whom you share this token as it exposes the sensitive data collected from participants. We recommend choosing a short expiration date for Tokens that you create.","title":"Data Download: Accessing the Collected Data","component":"ddm","version":"develop","name":"data_download","url":"/ddm/develop/researchers/data_center/data_download.html","titles":[{"text":"Download Donations Through the Project Hub","hash":"_download_donations_through_the_project_hub","id":1},{"text":"Download Questionnaire Responses Through the Project Hub","hash":"_download_questionnaire_responses_through_the_project_hub","id":2},{"text":"Download via API","hash":"_download_via_api","id":3}]},"59":{"id":59,"text":"DDM Researchers Data Center Statistics Figure 1.

These templating features are available in the briefing text, the debriefing text, instruction texts, as well as in question texts and item texts for questions that are connected to a Blueprint. In these fields, you can tailor which and how data is shown to participants based on certain conditions, such as whether a participant has successfully donated their data or has skipped the donation step. By using so-called template tags, template filters, and template variables, you can create dynamic and personalized content that adapts to different scenarios, ensuring the information presented is both relevant and clear. This is an advanced feature. Use the templating features with caution. Misspecifications of tags and filters can lead to errors that will interrupt the flow for participants and can even break the application by causing a server error (502). We therefore advise to always thoroughly test templates including any tags, filters, or variables. Below, you find information on which variables, tags, and filters are available. In all fields where the template features are available, the following variables can be used: participant_id: The external ID of the participant. url_parameter: A dictionary containing the URL parameters extracted from the initial URL. For example, this variable could look like {'url_param_a': <value A>, 'url_param_b': <value B>} and you would access a specific value by including {{ url_parameter.url_param_a }} in your text field. briefing_consent: If you enable the briefing consent on the Briefing page, this variable will be 1 if participant has consented to participation and 0 otherwise. If you have not enabled briefing consent, then this will be None. donation_info: A dictionary containing information on the status of a participant’s donation. Contains the following information which can be included in a text field as {{ donation_info.n_success }}: \"donation_info\": { \"n_success\": 1, # number of successfully uploaded blueprints by this participant (regardless of consent). \"n_pending\": 1, # number of pending (i.e., not attempted) blueprint uploads. \"n_failed\": 0, # number of blueprints where an upload was attempted but failed. \"n_consent\": 1, # number of successful uploads to which donation consent was given. \"n_no_consent\": 0, # number of successful uploads to which no donation consent was given. \"n_no_data_extracted\": 0 # number of donations by this participant where all entries were filtered out } Additionally, in questions related to a specific Donation Blueprint, you can access the data that a participant has uploaded for this specific Blueprint in the question text and item texts: donated_data: The data uploaded by the participant for a specific Blueprint. Variables can be used by including them in double curly brackets in the text field. For example, in the debriefing text you could write: This is your personal participation ID: {{ participant_id }}. which would then be presented to a participant as \"This is your personal participation ID: 123456789.\" The following template tags are supported: {% if %}/{% elif %}/{% else %}/{% endif %}: Conditional rendering to include content based on a true/false statement (more information). {% for %}/{% endfor %}: Iteration over a sequence to render content multiple times (more information). {% ifchanged %}/{% else %}/{% endifchanged %}: Checks if a value has changed compared to the last iteration of a for-loop (more information). {% regroup %}: Use to regroup a consistently structured list (more information). Template tags can be used by enclosing them in {% <…​> %}. For example, on the debriefing page, you could write: {% if donation_info.n_consent == 0 %}Unfortunately, you did not donate any data.{% else %}Thank you very much for donationg your data!{% endif %} If a person has agreed to donate at least some of their data, they will see the following on the debriefing page: \"Thank you very much for donating your data!\". Note that for most tags it is important to close them (in the example by including {% endif %}), otherwise an error occurs and the text will not be rendered at all. For more details and examples, see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/language/#tags. The following template filters can be used to modify the output of variables: date: Formats a date according to the given format string (more information). default: Provides a default value if the variable evaluates to False (more information). dictsort:\"var\": Sorts a list of dictionaries by the provided variable (more information). dictsortreversed:\"var\": Sorts a list of dictionaries by the provided variable in reversed order (more information). first: Returns the first item in a list (more information). last: Returns the last item in a list (more information). length: The length of a value (more information). random: Returns a random item from the given list (more information). truncatechars:n_chars: Truncates a string after a specified number of characters (more information). truncatewords:n_words: Truncates a string after a specified number of words (more information). Template filters can be used by adding them to a value (which can also be a variable) as follows: {{ value|filter }}. For example, {{ \"abcde\"|truncatechars:3 }} will render as \"abc…\". For more details and examples, see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/language/#filters. You may want to display a different debriefing text to participants that do not provide initial consent for participation. In this case you would use the following in the text configuration of your debriefing page: Dear participant I would like to tell you something about yourself. {% if briefing_consent == \"1\" %} You did consent to take part in this study and for this we are really grateful. {% else %} Unfortunately, you did not consent to take part in the study but we respect your decision and completely understand! :') {% endif %} Your public ID is as follows: \"{{ participant_id }}\". Please take a photo of this ID. If you wnat to request the deletion of your data at some point in the future you can send an e-mail with your personal public ID to someone@mail.com and your data will be deleted from our servers. A participant that consented to take part in the study will then see this question as follows: Dear participant I would like to tell you something about yourself. You did consent to take part in this study and for this we are really grateful. Your public ID is as follows: \"xHQVbrYUYXn5lklW3RGSeouX\". Please take a photo of this ID. If you wnat to request the deletion of your data at some point in the future you can send an e-mail with your personal public ID to someone@mail.com and your data will be deleted from our servers. Assuming you collect data donations from your participants that lead to the following data structure: [ {'title': 'First Title', 'timestamp': '2022-12-19T08:49:18'}, {'title': 'Second Title', 'timestamp': '2022-12-16T11:43:02'}, # ... ] When you want to display the title of the first element of that list in a question text, you can do this by specifying the question text as follows: This is the title of the last video you watched on YouTube: \"{{ donated_data.0.title }}\" Please indicate below, why you watched this video. This will then be rendered as follows: This is the title of the last video you watched on YouTube: \"First Title\" Please indicate below, why you watched this video. If you are starting to construct a dynamic question text, first include the complete data objects stored in the variables in your question text (e.g., {{ participant }}, {{ data }}). Next, open the link to your study in an anonymous browser window and go through the steps until you reach the questionnaire part. This way you can see how the data object is structured and figure out from there, how you can access the information on deeper levels of the data structure. You can then start to adjust the variables and reload the anonymous window every time you made a change to the question definition to see how your new specification will be rendered. We have extended the default Django Template Engine to create a tailored version that supports a subset of the full range of template tags and filters implemented in Django. This customized engine allows for enhanced control over which features are available to users, focusing on simplicity and security while maintaining core template functionality. Limiting the available template tags and filters, ensures security and performance while maintaining essential template functionalities and providing customization and flexibility to users.","title":"Templating Features","component":"ddm","version":"develop","name":"templating_features","url":"/ddm/develop/researchers/topics/templating_features.html","titles":[{"text":"Available Tags and Filters","hash":"_available_tags_and_filters","id":1},{"text":"Available Variables","hash":"_available_variables","id":2},{"text":"Usage","hash":"_usage","id":3},{"text":"Tags","hash":"_tags","id":4},{"text":"Usage","hash":"_usage_2","id":5},{"text":"Filters","hash":"_filters","id":6},{"text":"Usage","hash":"_usage_3","id":7},{"text":"Use Cases","hash":"_use_cases","id":8},{"text":"Different Debriefing Pages Depending on Participation Success","hash":"_different_debriefing_pages_depending_on_participation_success","id":9},{"text":"Display First Element of List in Data Donation","hash":"_display_first_element_of_list_in_data_donation","id":10},{"text":"Technical Implementation","hash":"_technical_implementation","id":11}]},"69":{"id":69,"text":"DDM Researchers Project Configuration Data Donation Configuration The data donation can be configured using so-called Uploaders, Instructions, and Blueprints. An Uploader essentially represents an upload form through which one file can be uploaded (either a ZIP container or a single file). For each Uploader, a set of Instructions for participants can be created that show how they can access and upload the requested file. A Blueprint is used to define what data will be extracted from the file that participants upload through the Uploader. Each Uploader has one or multiple associated Blueprints (although if an Uploader expects a single file, only one Blueprint can be associated with it). To configure the data donation step, go to the Project Hub and click on Data Donation in the Project Configuration section. You can then configure the Uploaders, Instructions, and Blueprints on the following page: Figure 1. Data Donation Admin Page When creating an Uploader, you have the following configuration options: Name Name of the Uploader. Will be publicly visible to participants in the header of the Uploader on the data donation page. Upload Type Either \"single file\" or \"zip file\" depending on whether your participants are expected to upload a single file (e.g., CSV or JSON File) or a ZIP-container. Index The position of the Uploader on the data donation page. Uploaders with a lower index will be displayed closer to the top of the page. This setting only has an effect, if you use multiple Uploaders in the same project. All-in-one consent By default, participants will be asked to consent to the donation of the data associated with each Blueprint. If all-in-one consent is enabled, participants will instead be asked to consent to submit all uploaded data at once. The all-in-one consent question will be displayed at the bottom of the Figure 2. Default Consent Figure 3. All-in-One Consent Associated Blueprints The Blueprints associated to this Uploader. Only associated Blueprints will be applied to the files uploaded through a particular Uploader. Once an Uploader is created, you can add Instructions to it. Donation Instructions consist of one or multiple instruction pages. Instruction pages are displayed as a slide show at the top of the Uploader on the donation page (see the figures on the data donation overview page). For each instruction page, the following can be configured: Text The instruction text displayed to the participants. Researchers can also upload and include images or gifs to guide participants through the data donation process in this field (currently, video upload is not supported). The participant’s external ID is available as a template variable to be included in the instruction text as follows: {{ participant_id }} which will be displayed to the participant as something like IPI2wHDWrHODDRKuo8zo101S. This is helpful to enable participants to continue the data donation at a later point in time (e.g., because it can take some time between requesting data takeout and being able to download it); read this section of the documentation to find out how this can be done. Index The order of the page in the slideshow. If no instructions are defined for an Uploader, the instruction section will be hidden in the participation view. When creating a Blueprint, you have the following configuration options: Name Name of the Blueprint. Will be publicly visible to participants. Therefore, it is important to define a meaningful name (e.g., \"Watch History\", \"Liked Posts\" or similar). Description Description of what information the Blueprint will extract from the uploaded file. If defined, the description will be visible for participants in the data donation step. Associated Uploader The Uploader to which the Blueprint is associated. File path Here, the path where the file is expected to be located within a ZIP file is defined. Only necessary, if the Blueprint is associated to a Uploader that expects a ZIP file. This path can include regex expressions for flexible file matching (see below). If a regex expression matches two files, DDM extracts the first one that matches the expression. Afterward, it does not look any further, even if the matched file does not contain the expected fields (see below). Therefore, we recommend to be as specific as possible when setting the file path. Examples for regex paths to match files Regex Description ^MyActivities\\.json Matches a file named MyActivities.json that is located at the root of the ZIP file. ^SpecificFolder/MyActivities\\.json Matches a file named MyActivities.json that is located in a folder named SpecificFolder in the root of the ZIP file. .*/MyActivities\\.json Matches the first file with the name MyActivities.json that can be located anywhere in the ZIP file. (^MyActivities\\.json|^MeineAktivitäten\\.json|^MieAttivita\\.json) Matches a file that is located at the root of the ZIP file and either named MyActivities.json, MeineAktivitäten.json, or MieAttivita.json. Can be helpful to match the same file in different languages. You can find about more about regex here. On this website, you will also find some Tools that can help you test regex patterns. Expected fields The fields that must be contained in the file from which information should be extracted. If a file does not contain all fields defined here, No Information will be extracted. Put the field names in double quotes (\") and separate them with commas (\"Field A\", \"Field B\"). You can also use regular expressions (regex) to match expected fields - for this, you must enable the expected field regex matching option (see below). Expected field regex matching Select if you use a regex expression in the Expected fields setting. Expected File Format The file format of the file from which information should be extracted. Currently, only JSON and CSV is implemented. Extraction Root Indicates on which level of the files' data structure information should be extracted. If you want to extract information contained on the first level (e.g., {'field to be extracted': value}, you can leave this field empty. If you want to extract data located on a higher level, then you would provide the path to the parent field of the data you want to extract (e.g., if your json file is structured like this {'friends': {'real_friends': [{'name to extract': name, 'date to extract': date}], 'fake friends': [{'name': name, 'date': date }]}} and you want to extract the names and dates of real_friends, you would set the extraction root to friends.real_friends. CSV Delimiter This field allows you to specify the character that separates values in the expected CSV file. (e.g., ,, ; or \\t). If left empty, DDM will try to infer the delimiter from the file structure. The settings above are used to identify and validate the correct file from which data should be extracted. When the file validation is successful, the Blueprint will start to extract information from the file. For this, it uses Extraction Rules which will be applied to the file one after another. The base assumption for the extraction of the data contained in a file is that you do not want any data. This means that when you configure your extraction rules, you first have to add a \"Keep Field\"-rule for each field that you want to keep in your data (see the setting Extraction Operator below). Execution Order The order in which the extraction rules are applied to a file. Name The name of an extraction rule. For internal organisation only. Field The field to which the rule will be applied. This can either be a \"normal\" string or a regular expression (regex). If the latter is the case, you must also select regex field (below). Regex field Select if you use a regex expression in the Field setting of this rule. Extraction Operator Defines the main logic of the extraction step. Below, you see the list of available extraction operators: Extraction Operator Description Note Keep Field Keep this field in the uploaded data. – Equal (==) Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given field equals the comparison value. Works for strings, integers, and dates1. Not Equal (!=) Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given field does not equal the comparison value. Works for strings, integers, and dates1. Greater than (>) Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given field is greater than the comparison value. Works for integers and dates1. String values are skipped and the row will be kept in the data. Smaller than (<) Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given field is smaller than the comparison value. Works for integers and dates1. String values are skipped and the row will be kept in the data. Greater than or equal (>=) Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given field is greater than or equal to the comparison value. Works for integers and dates1. String values are skipped and the row will be kept in the data. Smaller than or equal (⇐) Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given field is smaller than or equal to the comparison value. Works for integers and dates1. String values are skipped and the row will be kept in the data. Delete match (regex) Delete parts of the value contained in the given field that match the given regular expression (regex) (e.g., if the regular expression (regex) = \"^Watched \" and a field contains the value \"Watched video XY\" the following value will be kept in the uploaded data: \"video XY\"). All field values are converted to strings before this operation is applied. Replace match (regex) Replace parts of the value contained in the given field that match the given regular expression (regex) (e.g., if the regular expression (regex) = \"@([\\w-]\\.)+[\\w-]{2,4}\" and the replacement value = \"anonymized\" and a field contains the value \"some text email@address.com\" the following value will be kept in the uploaded data: \"some text anonymized\"). All field values are converted to strings before this operation is applied. Delete row when match (regex) Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given field matches the given regular expression (regex) (e.g., if regular expression (regex) = \"^Watched \" and a field contains the value \"Watched video XY\" the row/entry will be deleted from the uploaded data). All field values are converted to strings before this operation is applied. 1 Dates are inferred from string values if they are formatted according to ISO, RFC2822, or HTTP standards, and only if both the field value and the comparison value follow the same format. Otherwise, the entry will be treated as a regular string. Comparison Value The value against which the data contained in the indicated field will be compared according to the selected Extraction Operator. Replacement Value Only required for operation \"Replace match (regex)\". The value that will be used as a replacement if the regex pattern matches.","title":"Data Donation Configuration","component":"ddm","version":"develop","name":"datadonation_configuration","url":"/ddm/develop/researchers/project_configuration/datadonation/datadonation_configuration.html","titles":[{"text":"Configure Uploader","hash":"_configure_uploader","id":1},{"text":"Configure Instructions","hash":"_configure_instructions","id":2},{"text":"Configure Blueprints","hash":"_configure_blueprints","id":3},{"text":"JSON specific settings","hash":"_json_specific_settings","id":4},{"text":"CSV specific settings","hash":"_csv_specific_settings","id":5},{"text":"Extraction Rules","hash":"_extraction_rules","id":6}]},"70":{"id":70,"text":"DDM Researchers Project Configuration Data Donation Overview The data donation page will be displayed to participants after the briefing page. Before providing more information on the configuration options of the data donation page, it is helpful to get a first overview from both the participants' and the researchers' perspectives. From the participants' perspective, this page includes: The donation instructions. An upload form through which participants can upload their data donation. The option to review the uploaded data before giving explicit consent. A consent form (or multiple consent forms). When first accessing the page, it looks as follows: Figure 1. Data Donation Page In the top part of the data donation page the participants see the instructions on how to download the file you want them to download. Below in the middle is the upload form (the so-called Uploader – see <add where to see>) where the participants will upload their data file. At the bottom is a description of the data that will be extracted from the uploaded file (each line corresponds to one Blueprint). Once a participant uploads a file, the page will look as follows: Figure 2. Data Donation Page After Upload Now, the participant can see the extracted data (for each File Blueprint) and decide case by case whether to submit these data to the researcher. From the researchers' perspective, the purpose of the data donation page is to: Providing participants with instructions. Providing participants the possibility to upload their donation. Verify that the participant uploads the correct data. Clean and filter the data that participants upload according to pre-defined extraction rules. Provide the participant the possibility to review the cleansed and filtered data before data transmission. Obtain informed consent from participants. These steps take all place on the participants devices and no personal data leave the participants' devices before they provide their consent and click on \"transmit data\" (see xref: to learn more about how DDM’s data processing).

As shown before, the following question types are implemented: Single Choice Question: Multi Choice Question Matrix Question Semantic Differential Open Question Text Block (plain text, without any response options for the participant) Depending on the question type, different configuration options are available. The following configuration settings are available for all question types: Name A question name. This name is only used for internal organisation and is not visible to participants. Blueprint A question can either be general or related to a Blueprint. General questions are displayed to all participants, regardless if they successfully donated any data. Questions related to a Blueprint are only displayed to those participants that successfully uploaded some data to the related file blueprint. This means that if no donated data were extracted by the related Blueprint (either because the extraction failed, was not attempted or all entries were filtered out by the extraction rules), the question will not be displayed. Consult the section on integrating donated data in the questionnaire for more information. Page Number of the page on which the question will be displayed. Index Order in which questions on the same page will be displayed. Variable Name The variable name associated to a question. This name will be included in the data export. For items belonging to a question, the variable name will be constructed as follows: \"question_variable_name-{item-value}\". Text The question text that is displayed to participants. Required If a question is marked as required, the application will show a hint to the participant if they forgot to answer this question. This hint will only be shown once. This means that if a participant chooses to ignore the hint and clicks on 'continue', they are able to skip a required question. Randomize items Enable or disable randomization of all items. Input type Define whether to apply restrictions for the input to this field. Can be 'text' to allow any kind of text, 'number' to only allow numerical characters, or 'email' to only allow valid email addresses. Default is 'text'. Maximum input length Restricts the input to a certain number of characters. If this option is left empty, no input length restriction is enforced. Display Define whether to show a 'small' one-line input field or a larger multi-line text-box. Defaults to \"small\" and only applies when the chosen input type is \"Text\". The input type and maximum input length options are only \"softly\" enforced in the participant’s browser by hinting at and highlighting non-compliant input. This means that these restrictions are not enforced on the server-side if participants choose to ignore the input hint. For Single Choice Questions, Multiple Choice Questions, Matrix Questions and Semantic Differentials, participants answer in relation to question items. To configure question items, the following settings are available: Index Defines the order in which the items are displayed. Label The label/text of the item that is displayed to participants related to an item. For semantic differential questions, this is the label displayed on the left-hand side of the scale. Label Right Only for semantic differential questions. The label displayed on the right-hand side of the scale. Value Is (a) the identifier of an item and (b) used to indicate which item(s) has or have been selected in the data export (only for Single and Multi Choice Questions). Randomize Instead of randomizing the order of all items with the randomize setting on the question level, this setting allows randomizing only certain items while those for which this option is not ticked stay in their place (i.e., according to their index). Delete Tick this box if the item should be deleted. The item will be deleted as soon as you click on Update Items. For Matrix Questions and Semantic Differentials, participants give their answers (or in other words: rate the question items) with the configured question scale. Index Defines the order in which the items are displayed. Label The label/text that is displayed to participants associated to the scale point. Value Used to indicate which scale point has been selected in the data export. Add border Setting currently has no effect - Still need to be implemented.

There are two types of data that can be integrated in a questionnaire: Metadata related to the participant and data contained in the donated data. This data can be integrated by using the follwing pattern in the text field of your question or item: This is the variable I would like to render {{ VARIABLE_NAME }}. Regarding the metadata related to the participant, you can integrate the following information in your questionnaire: participant_id: The external ID of the participant. url_parameter: A dictionary containing the URL parameters extracted from the initial URL. For example, this variable could look like {'url_param_a': <value A>, 'url_param_b': <value B>} and you would access a specific value by including {{ url_paramerer.url_param_a }} in your text field. briefing_consent: If you enable the briefing consent on the Briefing page, this variable will be 1 if participant has consented to participation and 0 otherwise. If you have not enabled briefing consent, then this will be None. donation_info: A dictionary containing information on the status of a participant’s donation.

This will usually be a JSON-object, but how this object is structured is dependent on the donation that you collect and cannot be described universally. To integrate data in your question or item text, DDM makes use of a restricted version of the Django templating system. This means that you can use so-called filters, tags, and variables to render information dynamically and conditionally per participant. To get further information on how to do this and also find some examples, visit the templating features page.","title":"Data Integration","component":"ddm","version":"develop","name":"questionnaire_data_integration","url":"/ddm/develop/researchers/project_configuration/questionnaire/questionnaire_data_integration.html","titles":[{"text":"Available Data","hash":"_available_data","id":1},{"text":"Participant-Related Data","hash":"_participant_related_data","id":2},{"text":"Donation-Related Data","hash":"_donation_related_data","id":3},{"text":"How to Integrate Data","hash":"_how_to_integrate_data","id":4}]},"73":{"id":73,"text":"DDM Researchers Project Configuration Questionnaire Overview Researchers can define a questionnaire that is displayed after the data donation step. It consists of one or more pages, each consisting of one or more questions. From the participants' perspective, the questionnaire will look something like this: Figure 1. Questionnaire The following question types are available in the questionnaire: Single Choice Question Multi Choice Question Matrix Question Semantic Differential Open Question Transition Block (plain text, without any response options for the participant) You can find more details on the Questionnaire Configuration page. The questionnaire also offers the option to integrate parts of the donated data in the question text or the question items. For example, if participants donate a watch history, you could include the last watched element as part of a question to obtain responses in relation to that element (e.g., \"Why have you watched <TITLE OF LAST ELEMENT>\"). The part <TITLE OF LAST ELEMENT> will then be rendered for each participant individually, based on their donated data. You can find out more about the possibility to render data dynamically here. Currently, DDM’s built-in questionnaire does not offer the possibility to hide/display questions depending on the responses to previous questions in the questionnaire. Therefore, we recommend to use the built-in questionnaire in cases where either (A) you want to include information from the donated data in the question text or (B) your questionnaire is short and follows a simple structure. In other cases, we currently recommend to implement the questionnaire in a dedicated survey software to which you redirect your participants from the debriefing page. The questionnaire responses are only submitted to the server after all questions have been answered. This means that if a participants aborts the questionnaire after filling out, e.g., 2 out of 4 questions, no responses will be collected and saved on the server.","title":"Questionnaire Overview","component":"ddm","version":"develop","name":"questionnaire_overview","url":"/ddm/develop/researchers/project_configuration/questionnaire/questionnaire_overview.html","titles":[{"text":"Participants' Perspective","hash":"_participants_perspective","id":1},{"text":"Question Types","hash":"_question_types","id":2},{"text":"Integrate Donated Data in Questionnaire","hash":"_integrate_donated_data_in_questionnaire","id":3},{"text":"Notes on the Questionnaire Flow","hash":"_notes_on_the_questionnaire_flow","id":4}]},"74":{"id":74,"text":"DDM Documentation for Participants This section might be added at a later stage.","title":"Documentation for Participants","component":"ddm","version":"main","name":"for_participants","url":"/ddm/main/for_participants.html","titles":[]},"75":{"id":75,"text":"DDM DDM Documentation DDM (Data Donation Module) is an open-source Django/web application that researcher can use to set up data donation projects and to collect data donations for academic research. It is developed by the Media Use and Effects Division at the University of Zurich. The Data Donation Module is embedded in the Data Donation Lab, a larger initiative of the University of Zurich and the Digital Society Initiative to strengthen the exchange about the topic of data donations and promote this data collection approach. For more information, visit https://datadonation.uzh.ch. The Data Donation Module enables researchers to setup a data donation project that, from the participants' perspective, consists of the following steps: 1) Briefing Page At the beginning, participants are presented with a briefing page. On this page, researchers can describe their project, brief participants about the upcoming steps, and optionally obtain explicit consent for participation. 2) Data Donation Next, participants are presented with a user interface through which they can donate their data. This interface consists of (1) a set of instructions, (2) a data upload form, and (3) a feedback area. The participation flow in this step looks as follows: The participant reads the instructions and downloads/finds the relevant file on their PC. The participant uploads their data with the provided upload form. The uploaded data is filtered and transformed according to the rules defined by the researcher (e.g., only certain fields are extracted). The participant is presented with the filtered/transformed data which they will be donating to the researchers. Based on d, the participant can decide whether to donate their data (i.e., submit their data to the reseacher’s server). Steps b to d are all client-based and executed in the participant’s browser. No personal data is submitted until step e. 3) Follow-Up Questionnaire (optional) After the data donation, participants can optionally be presented with a questionnaire. Questions defined in this questionnaire can be configured to include data points from the donated data – either to enrich the donated data or to provide participants with insights into their personal data. 4) End/Debriefing Page Lastly, participants are presented with a debriefing page. From here, participants can optionally be redirected to another website or web application. The application is intended to be hosted at an institutional level (e.g., a university, a university division, or a research conglomerate) as it provides the possibility to host multiple independent data donation projects simultaneously. Nevertheless, it is also possible to use it for single projects. For users (i.e., researchers), DDM is designed to be as easy to use as possible. Everything can be configured through a graphical user interface without requiring programming knowledge. Read more about DDM and its design philosophies in the accompanying article \"Data Donation Module: A Web Application for Collecting and Enriching Data Donations\" by N. Pfiffner, P. Witlox, and T. Friemel (2024) published in Computational Communication Research (https://doi.org/10.5117/CCR2024.2.4.PFIF).

Therefore, to run DDM you first need to install Python (3.8 or newer) and Django 4.2. For the installation of Python, please go to the official Python website: python.org The installation of Django is described in the next section. If you are planning to install DDM for production use, we advise to follow a comprehensive tutorial such as the one provided by Digital Ocean. Setting up DDM includes the following steps: Create Django application. Install DDM. Customize installation. DDM has the following dependencies which will be installed when installing django-ddm through pip: asgiref Django 4.2 django-ckeditor-5 django-polymorphic django-webpack-loader djangorestframework pycryptodome sqlparse To install Django and DDM, we strongly advise to use a new virtual environment (venv) for the installation. To create a new venv, run the following command in the folder where you want your installation to be located (the commands listed here should work for Linux and macOS; for other setups see here). ProjectPath> python -m venv /path/to/venv Then you can activate the environment as follows: ProjectPath> source /path/to/venv/bin/activate (venv) ProjectPath> Next, install Django in your virtual environment: (venv) ProjectPath> pip install Django==4.2.* Now that Django is installed, start a new project and access it: (venv) ProjectPath> django-admin startproject yourproject (venv) ProjectPath> cd yourproject This will create a new folder yourproject that contains a file called manage.py and a folder that is also called yourproject. In this subfolder you will find, among others, the settings.py and the urls.py file. Next, create a superuser account with your Django project: (venv) ProjectPath/yourproject> python manage.py createsuperuser You will be asked to provide a username and a password. To see whether the installation of Django worked run the following command and see whether the base site loads: (venv) ProjectPath/yourproject> python manage.py runserver Install the Django DDM package: (venv) ProjectPath/yourproject> pip install django-ddm Next, you will have to adjust several sections of your settings.py and urls.py files. First, add the necessary entries to INSTALLED_APPS in your settings.py: # settings.py INSTALLED_APPS = [ # ..., 'ddm', 'ddm.auth', 'ddm.logging', 'ddm.questionnaire', 'ddm.datadonation', 'ddm.participation', 'ddm.projects', 'ddm.core', 'django_ckeditor_5', 'webpack_loader', 'rest_framework', 'rest_framework.authtoken', ] Add the following configuration for webpack-loader to your settings.py: # settings.py # For production use: import os WEBPACK_LOADER = { 'DEFAULT': { 'CACHE': True, 'BUNDLE_DIR_NAME': 'ddm_core/vue/', 'STATS_FILE': os.path.join(STATIC_ROOT, 'ddm_core/vue/webpack-stats.json'), 'POLL_INTERVAL': 0.1, 'IGNORE': [r'.+\\.hot-update.js', r'.+\\.map'], } } # For development use: import os import ddm.core WEBPACK_LOADER = { 'DEFAULT': { 'CACHE': False, 'BUNDLE_DIR_NAME': 'core/vue/', 'STATS_FILE': os.path.join( os.path.dirname(ddm.core.__file__), 'static/ddm_core/vue/webpack-stats.json' ), 'POLL_INTERVAL': 0.1, # Adjust as needed 'IGNORE': [r'.+\\.hot-update.js', r'.+\\.map'], } } Add the DDM context processor to your template context processors. This will enable the version indicator of the currently used DDM distribution below the header in the admin interface. # settings.py TEMPLATES = [ { 'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates', 'DIRS': ['templates'], 'APP_DIRS': True, 'OPTIONS': { 'context_processors': [ # ... 'ddm.core.context_processors.add_ddm_version' # Add this. ], }, }, ] Configure CKEditor settings in your settings.py to allow your users to upload images, videos and PDFs in instructions and question texts (see https://github.com/hvlads/django-ckeditor-5 for further information): # settings.py CKEDITOR_5_FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION = 'authenticated' CKEDITOR_5_ALLOW_ALL_FILE_TYPES = True CKEDITOR_5_UPLOAD_FILE_TYPES = ['jpeg', 'pdf', 'png', 'mp4'] Add time zone support to your settings.py: # settings.py USE_TZ = True Optionally, an e-mail address restriction can be defined in settings.py. Only users whose e-mail address matches the defined regex pattern will be allowed to set up data donation projects: # settings.py DDM_SETTINGS = { 'EMAIL_PERMISSION_CHECK': r'.*(\\.|@)somedomain\\.com$', }, Include the DDM urls in your projects urls.py: # urls.py from django.urls import path, include # ... urlpatterns = [ # ... path('ddm/', include('ddm.core.urls')), ] Configure login and logout endpoints for DDM in urls.py: # urls.py from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views from django.urls import path, include # ... urlpatterns = [ # ... path('ddm/', include('ddm.core.urls')), path('login/', auth_views.LoginView.as_view(template_name='ddm_auth/login.html'), name='ddm_login'), # You can choose whatever path and template you like path('logout/', auth_views.LogoutView.as_view(), name='ddm_logout'), # You can choose whatever path and template you like path('ckeditor5/', include('django_ckeditor_5.urls')), # This is the endpoint that handles file uploads through the CKEditor. ] If you use DDM on a Django site together with wagtail, and you have internationalization enabled for your wagtail urls, we recommend to use the prefix_default_language=False for the i18n_patterns: # urls.py from django.conf.urls.i18n import i18n_patterns from django.urls import path, include from wagtail import urls as wagtail_urls # ... urlpatterns = [ # ... ] urlpatterns += i18n_patterns( path('', include(wagtail_urls)), prefix_default_language=False ) Not doing this will cause ddm.tests.test_apis.test_participant_deletion_with_regular_login to fail. In practice, the participant API still seems to work properly despite the test failing, however, unexpected behaviour cannot be ruled out at this point. This will be fixed in a future version. The Python installation includes SQLite which is configured to be used as a database backend in the standard settings.py created by Django. For a development environment, this SQLite is totally fine, however for a production deployment you should consider configuring a more robust and efficient database such as PostgreSQL or MariaDB (see the Django Documentation for further information). Once you have configured a database, run python manage.py migrate to create the ddm models in your database. To test if your installation was successful, run python manage.py test ddm. Next, run python manage.py runserver to start the server locally. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin to ensure that the Data Donation Module is listed as a subsection in the administration interface. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ddm/projects to see whether you can access the ddm project overview site and try to create a new project. You can provide default images to be included in the header of the participation views. These images will be displayed by default, but can be overwritten on a project-basis by researchers in the project settings. To enable default images, provide the paths to the images that you want to display in the left and/or right part of the public header in your settings.py as follows: # settings.py DDM_DEFAULT_HEADER_IMG_LEFT = '/path/to/logo_left.png' DDM_DEFAULT_HEADER_IMG_RIGHT = '/path/to/logo_right.png' DDM uses a custom CKEditor toolbar for instruction and question text definitions that can optionally be customized (find out more) Official Django Documentation Official Python Documentation Django Tutorials on W3Schools or Digital Ocean Information for developers in this documentation","title":"Installation Guide","component":"ddm","version":"main","name":"installation","url":"/ddm/main/administrators/installation.html","titles":[{"text":"Requirements","hash":"_requirements","id":1},{"text":"Create Django Application","hash":"_create_django_application","id":2},{"text":"Install DDM","hash":"_install_ddm","id":3},{"text":"Update Settings.py","hash":"_update_settings_py","id":4},{"text":"Update urls.py","hash":"_update_urls_py","id":5},{"text":"Apply Database Migrations","hash":"_apply_database_migrations","id":6},{"text":"Test Installation","hash":"_test_installation","id":7},{"text":"Optional Settings","hash":"_optional_settings","id":8},{"text":"Default Header Images","hash":"_default_header_images","id":9},{"text":"Customizing CKEditor","hash":"_customizing_ckeditor","id":10},{"text":"Further Resources","hash":"_further_resources","id":11}]},"79":{"id":79,"text":"DDM Developers This section of the documentation is targeted at people who contribute to the development of DDM or who want to learn more about its development in general. The repository includes a django test project that can be used for local development and testing. Once you have cloned or forked the GitHub repository, activate your local virtual environment and install the following requirements: (venv) <...>/ddm> pip install -r requirements.txt A basic standard configuration for the test project is specified in test_project/test_config.json. Adjust the information in this file if you want to use a custom setup, or use another database. By default, the test project uses SQLite as a database backend. If you do make changes to this file, please do NOT commit these changes to the shared repository. Through the setup described above, the regular django commands are now available: To start the development server use the following commands: (venv) <...>/ddm/test_project> python manage.py runserver To create new migrations based on the changes made to the models, run: (venv) <...>/ddm/test_project> python manage.py makemigrations To apply existing migrations to your local database, run: [1] (venv) <...>/ddm/test_project> python manage.py migrate To run unit tests, use: (venv) <...>/ddm/test_project> python manage.py test ddm First, install the appropriate node.js version according to the .node-version file. Then, install the node dependencies: (venv) <...>/ddm/frontend> npm install To run the app in development mode, you will need to serve both Django’s dev server and the webpack development server: From the frontend directory, run: (venv) <...>/ddm/frontend> npm run serve And, in a separate terminal in the Django root directory, run the Django development server: (venv) <...>/ddm/test_project> python manage.py runserver Open your locally hosted Django app in a browser (e.g. http://localhost:8000). Changes to the vue code will trigger an automatic reload of the page in the browser. When it is time to deploy, or when you simply want to omit running the Vue dev server, you can build the Vue project in production mode. Cancel the npm run serve process if it is running and instead run npm run build. The optimized bundles will be built in and placed into the Django static file location, and webpack-stats.json will be updated to reflect this new configuration. The vue builds should end up in the static folder of the django module (ddm/static). This project uses GitHub actions for automated testing and CI tasks. A push to develop triggers build tests for the following configurations: Python: [3.8, 3.10.4] Database: [sqlite, mysql] A tag (vX.X.X) push to develop triggers build tests (see above). If the tests are successful develop is automatically merged into main. Please make sure that pushed tags are in sync with package versions on PyPi. If the build-tests of a pushed tag fail, delete the tag[2] and push the fixed version again with the same tag until the tests run through. A push to main triggers build tests and if the tests are successful, automatically bumps the version number (patch number) and builds a new PyPi package. The tests have the same configurations as on develop. A pull request to main created by dependabot will automatically update the affected dependencies and merge into main. A regular push to develop triggers the following pipeline: Run tests on develop. Create new documentation for GitHub pages. A tag (\"vX.X.X\") push to develop triggers the following pipeline: Run tests on develop. Create new documentation for GitHub pages. Merge develop into main. Run tests on main. Create PyPi package. A pull request to main created by dependabot triggers the following pipeline: Update dependencies. Merge into main. Run tests on main. Create PyPi package. A new release is created manually and includes: Bumping the minor or major part of the version. Updating setup.cfg. Ideally, add a changelog.

Some words of caution: After a project has been created, it cannot be changed from super secret to regular and vice versa. There is no way to recover or reset the password used to initialize the super secret project in case it gets lost. Making a project \"super secret\" will limit the functionality of the module: it won’t be possible to create follow-up questions based on the data donation (i.e., data points from the data donation cannot be referenced in a question).

Visible to participants in the browser’s title bar or a page’s tab. URL Identifier The URL Identifier is a string that is added to the participation URL (e.g, www.some.url/project-slug). Your participants will take part in your project via this URL. The URL Identifier Can only contain letters, hyphens, numbers or underscores. Active Set a project to active or inactive. Participants can only take part in an active project. If participants open the link to an inactive project, they will be redirected to an information page telling them that participation in this project is currently not possible. This information will be accessible to your participants during all participation steps. Contact Information Contact information of the researcher responsible for the project. The contact information is linked in the footer of the participation interface and can be viewed by participants at any stage of the data donation process. Data Protection Statement Data protection statement that describes how the data is processed. The data protection statement is linked in the footer of the participation interface and can be viewed by participants at any stage of the data donation process. Information can be extracted from parameters passed with the URL when a project is accessed by a participant (e.g., www.some.url/project-slug?parameter_A=someId&parameter_B=socialMedia). This setting is optional. There are several scenarios, where you will want to make use of URL parameter extraction. For example: External questionnaire: If participants are asked to first fill out a questionnaire created in an external survey software such as, e.g. Unipark or Qualtrics, passing URL parameters can be used to link data donations with the survey data by passing a participant ID in the URL parameters. External recruitment partner: When you work together with an external recruitment partner (e.g., an access panel), you will usually need to extract the participants' identifiers from the URL. Tracking recruitment channels: When you recruit participants through different channels (e.g., social media, e-mail, or leaflets) you can use URL parameters to identify where your participants are coming from. The URL Parameter extraction can be configured using the following settings: URL parameter extraction enabled Enable or disable whether URL parameters should be extracted when participants access the project’s briefing page. Expected URL parameter Provide a string containing the parameters that should be extracted. Separate multiple parameters with a semicolon (e.g., \"parameter_A;parameter_B\"). The extracted values will be saved for each participant and is included in the data export. If a parameter is not present, it will be saved as None. Undefined parameters passed in the URL will be ignored. Participants can be redirected to another website from the debriefing page (this is optional). This can be configured using the following settings: Redirect enabled Enable or disable the redirection of your participants when they have completed your project. If enabled, a redirect button will be displayed on the data donation end page that redirects to the URL defined in the Redirect target setting. Redirect address The URL to which participants will be redirected (only required if redirect is enabled). The redirect URL can include information on the participant and the project ID. For this, you can use variables that are populated with the respective values. Currently, the following variables are supported: The participant data is accessible with {{ participant }}` and the project ID can be inserted with `{{ project_id }}`. E.g., `https://redirect.url?param={{url_parameter.URLParameter+}}&participant={{participant_id}}&project={{project_id}} See this section for more information on the variable inclusion.

For production use in the context of an academic institution we recommend implementing authentication through an academic authentication infrastructure with OpenID Connect (OIDC) - see below. In the case of single user instances, i.e., if DDM is installed and deployed to only support one specific project, this step is not necessary. TODO: Explain creation of researcher profiles: 1. Login/Register through default authentication → 2. Create a DDM research profile associated to authenticated account → 3. redirect to ddm projects For authentication to work properly make sure you do the following in your main site: Define a login and logout view in urls.py: from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views urlpatterns = [ # ... path('login/', auth_views.LoginView.as_view(template_name='myapp/login.html'), name='ddm_login'), path('logout/', auth_views.LogoutView.as_view(), name='ddm_logout'), ] Either, you define your own template ('myapp/login.html'), or you can reuse or customize the default DDM login template ('ddm_auth/login.html' or 'ddm_auth/login_oidc.html' if you use OIDC authentication). Define Proper redirect paths in your settings.py: # Paths to redirect after login/logout LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/auth/researcher/' LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = '/login/' We recommend using the package mozilla-django-oidc for OIDC authentication. To enable OIDC authentication with mozilla-django-oidc, follow these steps (see also the official mozilla-django-oidc documentation): Setup a client with an OpenID provider. Install mozilla-django-oidc: pip install mozilla-django-oidc Next, adjust your settings.py. Add 'mozilla_django_oidc' to INSTALLED_APPS after 'django.contrib.auth':: INSTALLED_APPS = ( # ...

It is site-level responsibility to setup encryption in transit, like SSL/TLS for all communication between clients and the server. For some hints on how this should be setup, start with the Django docs. We minimize the amount of potential data that is processed on the server, by doing most of the filtering client-side. Do take into account that ideally the connection from system to the database is secured as well, and that the database is stored on an encrypted system. The module stores all data in encrypted fields in the database, the encryption/decryption procedure is described below. Each project has a unique salt that is generated when creating the project. In the Django site settings, we use the SECRET_KEY as the default passphrase for encryption. If a project is working with sensitive data, we recommend that a project specific password is set. This password is only known by the person setting it and should not be shared. A project specific password will limit the functionality of the module for a given project: it won’t be possible to create follow-up questions based on the data donation. We use a hybrid asymmetric/symmetric encryption approach, due to the size limitation of the pure asymmetric approach. The encryption process consists of the following steps: - generate a public key and store it in the project (if none exists) - generate a session key used for encrypting a single message - encrypt the data symmetrically using the session key - encrypt the session key using the public key asymmetrically - store the encrypted data with the encrypted key as header The decryption process consists of the following steps: - generate a private key - get the desired encrypted data from the project - decrypt the encrypted session key (header) asymmetrically using the private key - decrypt the data using the decrypted session key symmetrically For encryption we only need the public key; - Check if we have a public key that is saved for the project - if not, we should have gotten a passphrase and a salt with which we can generate a public key. — generate the private key — derive the public key — save the public key for the project - We then use PKCS#1 OAEP for the wrapping and OAEP padding. For decryption we need the private key; - Using the supplied passphrase and salt, we generate a 128bit HMAC digest, which we use to populate a pseudo-random number generator. - This random number generator is used to generate our RSA key. - We then use PKCS#1 OAEP for wrapping the OAEP padding. There are significant limitations on the size of the data that can be encrypted using asymmetric algorithms and severe performance penalties. This is why we combine this with symmetric encryption. In our case we use AES to encrypt the actual data.","title":"Data Encryption","component":"ddm","version":"main","name":"encryption","url":"/ddm/main/developers/topics/encryption.html","titles":[{"text":"Encryption in transit and at rest","hash":"_encryption_in_transit_and_at_rest","id":1},{"text":"Encryption in transit","hash":"_encryption_in_transit","id":2},{"text":"Encryption at rest","hash":"_encryption_at_rest","id":3},{"text":"Encryption and decryption process","hash":"_encryption_and_decryption_process","id":4},{"text":"Steps","hash":"_steps","id":5},{"text":"Asymmetric Key Generation and process","hash":"_asymmetric_key_generation_and_process","id":6},{"text":"Symmetric Key Generation and process","hash":"_symmetric_key_generation_and_process","id":7}]},"95":{"id":95,"text":"DDM Developers Topics Internationalization The administration interface for researchers currently only supports English.

Afterward, run django-admin compilemessages to create a django.mo file, which will be used by gettext for translation.

Can be opened in the browser where you are logged in to DDM. Next, you can download the data donations for each participant through the donation download link. For larger donation projects where you collect data donations from many participants, it may be more convenient to download the data donations through the API (see below). To download the questionnaire responses as a csv table, go to the Project Hub, scroll down to the section \"Data Center\" and download the file by clicking on Download CSV: Figure 3. Questionnaire Responses Download To download your data via the API, you first have to create an API token. You can do so by going to the \"Data Center\" section in your Project Hub, and then clicking on \"Manage Access Token\". In the page that opens you can create an API token that is used to authenticate your external download request. A list of available API endpoints and a more detailed description on how to use them can be found in the API section of the documentation. Through the admin interface, a project can only be accessed by the user who created it. This means that the internal download is only accessible for a project owner. The API token, on the other hand, can be used to share data access with colleagues working on the same project. However, be careful with whom you share this token as it exposes the sensitive data collected from participants. We recommend choosing a short expiration date for Tokens that you create.","title":"Data Download: Accessing the Collected Data","component":"ddm","version":"main","name":"data_download","url":"/ddm/main/researchers/data_center/data_download.html","titles":[{"text":"Download Donations Through the Project Hub","hash":"_download_donations_through_the_project_hub","id":1},{"text":"Download Questionnaire Responses Through the Project Hub","hash":"_download_questionnaire_responses_through_the_project_hub","id":2},{"text":"Download via API","hash":"_download_via_api","id":3}]},"97":{"id":97,"text":"DDM Researchers Data Center Statistics Figure 1.

These templating features are available in the briefing text, the debriefing text, instruction texts, as well as in question texts and item texts for questions that are connected to a Blueprint. In these fields, you can tailor which and how data is shown to participants based on certain conditions, such as whether a participant has successfully donated their data or has skipped the donation step. By using so-called template tags, template filters, and template variables, you can create dynamic and personalized content that adapts to different scenarios, ensuring the information presented is both relevant and clear. This is an advanced feature. Use the templating features with caution. Misspecifications of tags and filters can lead to errors that will interrupt the flow for participants and can even break the application by causing a server error (502). We therefore advise to always thoroughly test templates including any tags, filters, or variables. Below, you find information on which variables, tags, and filters are available. In all fields where the template features are available, the following variables can be used: participant_id: The external ID of the participant. url_parameter: A dictionary containing the URL parameters extracted from the initial URL. For example, this variable could look like {'url_param_a': <value A>, 'url_param_b': <value B>} and you would access a specific value by including {{ url_parameter.url_param_a }} in your text field. briefing_consent: If you enable the briefing consent on the Briefing page, this variable will be 1 if participant has consented to participation and 0 otherwise. If you have not enabled briefing consent, then this will be None. donation_info: A dictionary containing information on the status of a participant’s donation. Contains the following information which can be included in a text field as {{ donation_info.n_success }}: \"donation_info\": { \"n_success\": 1, # number of successfully uploaded blueprints by this participant (regardless of consent). \"n_pending\": 1, # number of pending (i.e., not attempted) blueprint uploads. \"n_failed\": 0, # number of blueprints where an upload was attempted but failed. \"n_consent\": 1, # number of successful uploads to which donation consent was given. \"n_no_consent\": 0, # number of successful uploads to which no donation consent was given. \"n_no_data_extracted\": 0 # number of donations by this participant where all entries were filtered out } Additionally, in questions related to a specific Donation Blueprint, you can access the data that a participant has uploaded for this specific Blueprint in the question text and item texts: donated_data: The data uploaded by the participant for a specific Blueprint. Variables can be used by including them in double curly brackets in the text field. For example, in the debriefing text you could write: This is your personal participation ID: {{ participant_id }}. which would then be presented to a participant as \"This is your personal participation ID: 123456789.\" The following template tags are supported: {% if %}/{% elif %}/{% else %}/{% endif %}: Conditional rendering to include content based on a true/false statement (more information). {% for %}/{% endfor %}: Iteration over a sequence to render content multiple times (more information). {% ifchanged %}/{% else %}/{% endifchanged %}: Checks if a value has changed compared to the last iteration of a for-loop (more information). {% regroup %}: Use to regroup a consistently structured list (more information). Template tags can be used by enclosing them in {% <…​> %}. For example, on the debriefing page, you could write: {% if donation_info.n_consent == 0 %}Unfortunately, you did not donate any data.{% else %}Thank you very much for donationg your data!{% endif %} If a person has agreed to donate at least some of their data, they will see the following on the debriefing page: \"Thank you very much for donating your data!\". Note that for most tags it is important to close them (in the example by including {% endif %}), otherwise an error occurs and the text will not be rendered at all. For more details and examples, see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/language/#tags. The following template filters can be used to modify the output of variables: date: Formats a date according to the given format string (more information). default: Provides a default value if the variable evaluates to False (more information). dictsort:\"var\": Sorts a list of dictionaries by the provided variable (more information). dictsortreversed:\"var\": Sorts a list of dictionaries by the provided variable in reversed order (more information). first: Returns the first item in a list (more information). last: Returns the last item in a list (more information). length: The length of a value (more information). random: Returns a random item from the given list (more information). truncatechars:n_chars: Truncates a string after a specified number of characters (more information). truncatewords:n_words: Truncates a string after a specified number of words (more information). Template filters can be used by adding them to a value (which can also be a variable) as follows: {{ value|filter }}. For example, {{ \"abcde\"|truncatechars:3 }} will render as \"abc…\". For more details and examples, see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/templates/language/#filters. You may want to display a different debriefing text to participants that do not provide initial consent for participation. In this case you would use the following in the text configuration of your debriefing page: Dear participant I would like to tell you something about yourself. {% if briefing_consent == \"1\" %} You did consent to take part in this study and for this we are really grateful. {% else %} Unfortunately, you did not consent to take part in the study but we respect your decision and completely understand! :') {% endif %} Your public ID is as follows: \"{{ participant_id }}\". Please take a photo of this ID. If you wnat to request the deletion of your data at some point in the future you can send an e-mail with your personal public ID to someone@mail.com and your data will be deleted from our servers. A participant that consented to take part in the study will then see this question as follows: Dear participant I would like to tell you something about yourself. You did consent to take part in this study and for this we are really grateful. Your public ID is as follows: \"xHQVbrYUYXn5lklW3RGSeouX\". Please take a photo of this ID. If you wnat to request the deletion of your data at some point in the future you can send an e-mail with your personal public ID to someone@mail.com and your data will be deleted from our servers. Assuming you collect data donations from your participants that lead to the following data structure: [ {'title': 'First Title', 'timestamp': '2022-12-19T08:49:18'}, {'title': 'Second Title', 'timestamp': '2022-12-16T11:43:02'}, # ... ] When you want to display the title of the first element of that list in a question text, you can do this by specifying the question text as follows: This is the title of the last video you watched on YouTube: \"{{ donated_data.0.title }}\" Please indicate below, why you watched this video. This will then be rendered as follows: This is the title of the last video you watched on YouTube: \"First Title\" Please indicate below, why you watched this video. If you are starting to construct a dynamic question text, first include the complete data objects stored in the variables in your question text (e.g., {{ participant }}, {{ data }}). Next, open the link to your study in an anonymous browser window and go through the steps until you reach the questionnaire part. This way you can see how the data object is structured and figure out from there, how you can access the information on deeper levels of the data structure. You can then start to adjust the variables and reload the anonymous window every time you made a change to the question definition to see how your new specification will be rendered. We have extended the default Django Template Engine to create a tailored version that supports a subset of the full range of template tags and filters implemented in Django. This customized engine allows for enhanced control over which features are available to users, focusing on simplicity and security while maintaining core template functionality. Limiting the available template tags and filters, ensures security and performance while maintaining essential template functionalities and providing customization and flexibility to users.","title":"Templating Features","component":"ddm","version":"main","name":"templating_features","url":"/ddm/main/researchers/topics/templating_features.html","titles":[{"text":"Available Tags and Filters","hash":"_available_tags_and_filters","id":1},{"text":"Available Variables","hash":"_available_variables","id":2},{"text":"Usage","hash":"_usage","id":3},{"text":"Tags","hash":"_tags","id":4},{"text":"Usage","hash":"_usage_2","id":5},{"text":"Filters","hash":"_filters","id":6},{"text":"Usage","hash":"_usage_3","id":7},{"text":"Use Cases","hash":"_use_cases","id":8},{"text":"Different Debriefing Pages Depending on Participation Success","hash":"_different_debriefing_pages_depending_on_participation_success","id":9},{"text":"Display First Element of List in Data Donation","hash":"_display_first_element_of_list_in_data_donation","id":10},{"text":"Technical Implementation","hash":"_technical_implementation","id":11}]},"107":{"id":107,"text":"DDM Researchers Project Configuration Data Donation Configuration The data donation can be configured using so-called Uploaders, Instructions, and Blueprints. An Uploader essentially represents an upload form through which one file can be uploaded (either a ZIP container or a single file). For each Uploader, a set of Instructions for participants can be created that show how they can access and upload the requested file. A Blueprint is used to define what data will be extracted from the file that participants upload through the Uploader. Each Uploader has one or multiple associated Blueprints (although if an Uploader expects a single file, only one Blueprint can be associated with it). To configure the data donation step, go to the Project Hub and click on Data Donation in the Project Configuration section. You can then configure the Uploaders, Instructions, and Blueprints on the following page: Figure 1. Data Donation Admin Page When creating an Uploader, you have the following configuration options: Name Name of the Uploader. Will be publicly visible to participants in the header of the Uploader on the data donation page. Upload Type Either \"single file\" or \"zip file\" depending on whether your participants are expected to upload a single file (e.g., CSV or JSON File) or a ZIP-container. Index The position of the Uploader on the data donation page. Uploaders with a lower index will be displayed closer to the top of the page. This setting only has an effect, if you use multiple Uploaders in the same project. All-in-one consent By default, participants will be asked to consent to the donation of the data associated with each Blueprint. If all-in-one consent is enabled, participants will instead be asked to consent to submit all uploaded data at once. The all-in-one consent question will be displayed at the bottom of the Figure 2. Default Consent Figure 3. All-in-One Consent Associated Blueprints The Blueprints associated to this Uploader. Only associated Blueprints will be applied to the files uploaded through a particular Uploader. Once an Uploader is created, you can add Instructions to it. Donation Instructions consist of one or multiple instruction pages. Instruction pages are displayed as a slide show at the top of the Uploader on the donation page (see the figures on the data donation overview page). For each instruction page, the following can be configured: Text The instruction text displayed to the participants. Researchers can also upload and include images or gifs to guide participants through the data donation process in this field (currently, video upload is not supported). The participant’s external ID is available as a template variable to be included in the instruction text as follows: {{ participant_id }} which will be displayed to the participant as something like IPI2wHDWrHODDRKuo8zo101S. This is helpful to enable participants to continue the data donation at a later point in time (e.g., because it can take some time between requesting data takeout and being able to download it); read this section of the documentation to find out how this can be done. Index The order of the page in the slideshow. If no instructions are defined for an Uploader, the instruction section will be hidden in the participation view. When creating a Blueprint, you have the following configuration options: Name Name of the Blueprint. Will be publicly visible to participants. Therefore, it is important to define a meaningful name (e.g., \"Watch History\", \"Liked Posts\" or similar). Description Description of what information the Blueprint will extract from the uploaded file. If defined, the description will be visible for participants in the data donation step. Associated Uploader The Uploader to which the Blueprint is associated. File path Here, the path where the file is expected to be located within a ZIP file is defined. Only necessary, if the Blueprint is associated to a Uploader that expects a ZIP file. This path can include regex expressions for flexible file matching (see below). If a regex expression matches two files, DDM extracts the first one that matches the expression. Afterward, it does not look any further, even if the matched file does not contain the expected fields (see below). Therefore, we recommend to be as specific as possible when setting the file path. Examples for regex paths to match files Regex Description ^MyActivities\\.json Matches a file named MyActivities.json that is located at the root of the ZIP file. ^SpecificFolder/MyActivities\\.json Matches a file named MyActivities.json that is located in a folder named SpecificFolder in the root of the ZIP file. .*/MyActivities\\.json Matches the first file with the name MyActivities.json that can be located anywhere in the ZIP file. (^MyActivities\\.json|^MeineAktivitäten\\.json|^MieAttivita\\.json) Matches a file that is located at the root of the ZIP file and either named MyActivities.json, MeineAktivitäten.json, or MieAttivita.json. Can be helpful to match the same file in different languages. You can find about more about regex here. On this website, you will also find some Tools that can help you test regex patterns. Expected fields The fields that must be contained in the file from which information should be extracted. If a file does not contain all fields defined here, No Information will be extracted. Put the field names in double quotes (\") and separate them with commas (\"Field A\", \"Field B\"). You can also use regular expressions (regex) to match expected fields - for this, you must enable the expected field regex matching option (see below). Expected field regex matching Select if you use a regex expression in the Expected fields setting. Expected File Format The file format of the file from which information should be extracted. Currently, only JSON and CSV is implemented. Extraction Root Indicates on which level of the files' data structure information should be extracted. If you want to extract information contained on the first level (e.g., {'field to be extracted': value}, you can leave this field empty. If you want to extract data located on a higher level, then you would provide the path to the parent field of the data you want to extract (e.g., if your json file is structured like this {'friends': {'real_friends': [{'name to extract': name, 'date to extract': date}], 'fake friends': [{'name': name, 'date': date }]}} and you want to extract the names and dates of real_friends, you would set the extraction root to friends.real_friends. CSV Delimiter This field allows you to specify the character that separates values in the expected CSV file. (e.g., ,, ; or \\t). If left empty, DDM will try to infer the delimiter from the file structure. The settings above are used to identify and validate the correct file from which data should be extracted. When the file validation is successful, the Blueprint will start to extract information from the file. For this, it uses Extraction Rules which will be applied to the file one after another. The base assumption for the extraction of the data contained in a file is that you do not want any data. This means that when you configure your extraction rules, you first have to add a \"Keep Field\"-rule for each field that you want to keep in your data (see the setting Extraction Operator below). Execution Order The order in which the extraction rules are applied to a file. Name The name of an extraction rule. For internal organisation only. Field The field to which the rule will be applied. This can either be a \"normal\" string or a regular expression (regex). If the latter is the case, you must also select regex field (below). Regex field Select if you use a regex expression in the Field setting of this rule. Extraction Operator Defines the main logic of the extraction step. Below, you see the list of available extraction operators: Extraction Operator Description Note Keep Field Keep this field in the uploaded data. – Equal (==) Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given field equals the comparison value. Works for strings, integers, and dates1. Not Equal (!=) Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given field does not equal the comparison value. Works for strings, integers, and dates1. Greater than (>) Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given field is greater than the comparison value. Works for integers and dates1. String values are skipped and the row will be kept in the data. Smaller than (<) Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given field is smaller than the comparison value. Works for integers and dates1. String values are skipped and the row will be kept in the data. Greater than or equal (>=) Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given field is greater than or equal to the comparison value. Works for integers and dates1. String values are skipped and the row will be kept in the data. Smaller than or equal (⇐) Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given field is smaller than or equal to the comparison value. Works for integers and dates1. String values are skipped and the row will be kept in the data. Delete match (regex) Delete parts of the value contained in the given field that match the given regular expression (regex) (e.g., if the regular expression (regex) = \"^Watched \" and a field contains the value \"Watched video XY\" the following value will be kept in the uploaded data: \"video XY\"). All field values are converted to strings before this operation is applied. Replace match (regex) Replace parts of the value contained in the given field that match the given regular expression (regex) (e.g., if the regular expression (regex) = \"@([\\w-]\\.)+[\\w-]{2,4}\" and the replacement value = \"anonymized\" and a field contains the value \"some text email@address.com\" the following value will be kept in the uploaded data: \"some text anonymized\"). All field values are converted to strings before this operation is applied. Delete row when match (regex) Delete row/entry if the value contained in the given field matches the given regular expression (regex) (e.g., if regular expression (regex) = \"^Watched \" and a field contains the value \"Watched video XY\" the row/entry will be deleted from the uploaded data). All field values are converted to strings before this operation is applied. 1 Dates are inferred from string values if they are formatted according to ISO, RFC2822, or HTTP standards, and only if both the field value and the comparison value follow the same format. Otherwise, the entry will be treated as a regular string.

Before providing more information on the configuration options of the data donation page, it is helpful to get a first overview from both the participants' and the researchers' perspectives. From the participants' perspective, this page includes: The donation instructions. An upload form through which participants can upload their data donation. The option to review the uploaded data before giving explicit consent. A consent form (or multiple consent forms). When first accessing the page, it looks as follows: Figure 1. Data Donation Page In the top part of the data donation page the participants see the instructions on how to download the file you want them to download. Below in the middle is the upload form (the so-called Uploader – see <add where to see>) where the participants will upload their data file. At the bottom is a description of the data that will be extracted from the uploaded file (each line corresponds to one Blueprint). Once a participant uploads a file, the page will look as follows: Figure 2. Data Donation Page After Upload Now, the participant can see the extracted data (for each File Blueprint) and decide case by case whether to submit these data to the researcher. From the researchers' perspective, the purpose of the data donation page is to: Providing participants with instructions. Providing participants the possibility to upload their donation. Verify that the participant uploads the correct data. Clean and filter the data that participants upload according to pre-defined extraction rules. Provide the participant the possibility to review the cleansed and filtered data before data transmission. Obtain informed consent from participants. These steps take all place on the participants devices and no personal data leave the participants' devices before they provide their consent and click on \"transmit data\" (see xref: to learn more about how DDM’s data processing). The next pages will guide you through how you can configure the data donation step.","title":"Data Donation Overview","component":"ddm","version":"main","name":"datadonation_overview","url":"/ddm/main/researchers/project_configuration/datadonation/datadonation_overview.html","titles":[{"text":"Participants' Perspective","hash":"_participants_perspective","id":1},{"text":"Researchers' Perspective","hash":"_researchers_perspective","id":2}]},"109":{"id":109,"text":"DDM Researchers Project Configuration Questionnaire Configuration This page explains the settings related to the configuration of the questionnaire and its questions. As shown before, the following question types are implemented: Single Choice Question: Multi Choice Question Matrix Question Semantic Differential Open Question Text Block (plain text, without any response options for the participant) Depending on the question type, different configuration options are available. The following configuration settings are available for all question types: Name A question name. This name is only used for internal organisation and is not visible to participants. Blueprint A question can either be general or related to a Blueprint. General questions are displayed to all participants, regardless if they successfully donated any data. Questions related to a Blueprint are only displayed to those participants that successfully uploaded some data to the related file blueprint. This means that if no donated data were extracted by the related Blueprint (either because the extraction failed, was not attempted or all entries were filtered out by the extraction rules), the question will not be displayed. Consult the section on integrating donated data in the questionnaire for more information. Page Number of the page on which the question will be displayed. Index Order in which questions on the same page will be displayed. Variable Name The variable name associated to a question. This name will be included in the data export. For items belonging to a question, the variable name will be constructed as follows: \"question_variable_name-{item-value}\". Text The question text that is displayed to participants. Required If a question is marked as required, the application will show a hint to the participant if they forgot to answer this question. This hint will only be shown once. This means that if a participant chooses to ignore the hint and clicks on 'continue', they are able to skip a required question. Randomize items Enable or disable randomization of all items. Input type Define whether to apply restrictions for the input to this field. Can be 'text' to allow any kind of text, 'number' to only allow numerical characters, or 'email' to only allow valid email addresses. Default is 'text'. Maximum input length Restricts the input to a certain number of characters. If this option is left empty, no input length restriction is enforced. Display Define whether to show a 'small' one-line input field or a larger multi-line text-box. Defaults to \"small\" and only applies when the chosen input type is \"Text\". The input type and maximum input length options are only \"softly\" enforced in the participant’s browser by hinting at and highlighting non-compliant input. This means that these restrictions are not enforced on the server-side if participants choose to ignore the input hint. For Single Choice Questions, Multiple Choice Questions, Matrix Questions and Semantic Differentials, participants answer in relation to question items. To configure question items, the following settings are available: Index Defines the order in which the items are displayed. Label The label/text of the item that is displayed to participants related to an item. For semantic differential questions, this is the label displayed on the left-hand side of the scale. Label Right Only for semantic differential questions. The label displayed on the right-hand side of the scale. Value Is (a) the identifier of an item and (b) used to indicate which item(s) has or have been selected in the data export (only for Single and Multi Choice Questions). Randomize Instead of randomizing the order of all items with the randomize setting on the question level, this setting allows randomizing only certain items while those for which this option is not ticked stay in their place (i.e., according to their index). Delete Tick this box if the item should be deleted. The item will be deleted as soon as you click on Update Items. For Matrix Questions and Semantic Differentials, participants give their answers (or in other words: rate the question items) with the configured question scale. Index Defines the order in which the items are displayed. Label The label/text that is displayed to participants associated to the scale point. Value Used to indicate which scale point has been selected in the data export. Add border Setting currently has no effect - Still need to be implemented. Delete Tick this box if the scale point should be deleted. The scale point will be deleted as soon as you click on Update Scale Points.","title":"Questionnaire Configuration","component":"ddm","version":"main","name":"questionnaire_configuration","url":"/ddm/main/researchers/project_configuration/questionnaire/questionnaire_configuration.html","titles":[{"text":"General Settings","hash":"_general_settings","id":1},{"text":"Specific Settings","hash":"_specific_settings","id":2},{"text":"Open Question","hash":"_open_question","id":3},{"text":"Question Items","hash":"_question_items","id":4},{"text":"Scale Configuration","hash":"_scale_configuration","id":5}]},"110":{"id":110,"text":"DDM Researchers Project Configuration Questionnaire Data Integration It is possible to dynamically include participant-related and/or donation-related information in a question text. There are two types of data that can be integrated in a questionnaire: Metadata related to the participant and data contained in the donated data. This data can be integrated by using the follwing pattern in the text field of your question or item: This is the variable I would like to render {{ VARIABLE_NAME }}. Regarding the metadata related to the participant, you can integrate the following information in your questionnaire: participant_id: The external ID of the participant. url_parameter: A dictionary containing the URL parameters extracted from the initial URL. For example, this variable could look like {'url_param_a': <value A>, 'url_param_b': <value B>} and you would access a specific value by including {{ url_paramerer.url_param_a }} in your text field. briefing_consent: If you enable the briefing consent on the Briefing page, this variable will be 1 if participant has consented to participation and 0 otherwise. If you have not enabled briefing consent, then this will be None. donation_info: A dictionary containing information on the status of a participant’s donation. Contains the following information which can be included in a text field as {{ donation_info.n_success }}: \"donation_info\": { \"n_success\": 1, # number of successfully uploaded blueprints by this participant (regardless of consent). \"n_pending\": 1, # number of pending (i.e., not attempted) blueprint uploads. \"n_failed\": 0, # number of blueprints where an upload was attempted but failed. \"n_consent\": 1, # number of successful uploads to which donation consent was given. \"n_no_consent\": 0, # number of successful uploads to which no donation consent was given. \"n_no_data_extracted\": 0 # number of donations by this participant where all entries were filtered out } Additionally, in questions related to a specific Blueprint, you can access the data that were extracted through this specific Blueprint in the question text and item texts by using the following variable: donated_data: The data uploaded by the participant for a specific Blueprint. This will usually be a JSON-object, but how this object is structured is dependent on the donation that you collect and cannot be described universally. To integrate data in your question or item text, DDM makes use of a restricted version of the Django templating system. This means that you can use so-called filters, tags, and variables to render information dynamically and conditionally per participant. To get further information on how to do this and also find some examples, visit the templating features page.","title":"Data Integration","component":"ddm","version":"main","name":"questionnaire_data_integration","url":"/ddm/main/researchers/project_configuration/questionnaire/questionnaire_data_integration.html","titles":[{"text":"Available Data","hash":"_available_data","id":1},{"text":"Participant-Related Data","hash":"_participant_related_data","id":2},{"text":"Donation-Related Data","hash":"_donation_related_data","id":3},{"text":"How to Integrate Data","hash":"_how_to_integrate_data","id":4}]},"111":{"id":111,"text":"DDM Researchers Project Configuration Questionnaire Overview Researchers can define a questionnaire that is displayed after the data donation step. It consists of one or more pages, each consisting of one or more questions. From the participants' perspective, the questionnaire will look something like this: Figure 1. Questionnaire The following question types are available in the questionnaire: Single Choice Question Multi Choice Question Matrix Question Semantic Differential Open Question Transition Block (plain text, without any response options for the participant) You can find more details on the Questionnaire Configuration page. The questionnaire also offers the option to integrate parts of the donated data in the question text or the question items. For example, if participants donate a watch history, you could include the last watched element as part of a question to obtain responses in relation to that element (e.g., \"Why have you watched <TITLE OF LAST ELEMENT>\"). The part <TITLE OF LAST ELEMENT> will then be rendered for each participant individually, based on their donated data. You can find out more about the possibility to render data dynamically here. Currently, DDM’s built-in questionnaire does not offer the possibility to hide/display questions depending on the responses to previous questions in the questionnaire. Therefore, we recommend to use the built-in questionnaire in cases where either (A) you want to include information from the donated data in the question text or (B) your questionnaire is short and follows a simple structure. In other cases, we currently recommend to implement the questionnaire in a dedicated survey software to which you redirect your participants from the debriefing page. The questionnaire responses are only submitted to the server after all questions have been answered. This means that if a participants aborts the questionnaire after filling out, e.g., 2 out of 4 questions, no responses will be collected and saved on the server.","title":"Questionnaire
